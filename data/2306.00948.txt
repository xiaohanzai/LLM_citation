@Panther et al. (2022):
Cited to provide information on the most likely host galaxy of FRB20190425A and the probability of true association.

@Abbott et al. (2020a):
Referenced to support the suggestion that the merger of the two neutron stars promptly collapsed into a black hole, based on the total mass of GW190425 and current constraints on the equation of state for dense nuclear matter.

@Moroianu et al. (2022); Zhang (2022):
Cited to present a proposed scenario for GW190425 that could explain the discrepancy between the LVK interpretation and the 2.5 hours delay post-merger, involving the formation of a highly spinning supramassive neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field and an equation of state consistent with proposed quark models.
@Moroianu et al. (2022):
Referenced to indicate that the association between GW190425 and FRB20190425A was previously discussed but not claimed to be conclusive, and to provide context for the purpose of the current work.

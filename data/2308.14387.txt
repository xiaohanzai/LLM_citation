Referenced to emphasize that the interferometric localizations of one-off FRB sources have enabled the measurement of the cosmic baryon density in the low-redshift Universe.

@James et al. 2022:
Cited to highlight that localised FRB sources from ASKAP, along with Parkes-detected FRBs, have provided an independent measurement of Hubble's constant, and that a more precise measurement may be possible with a larger sample of localised FRBs in the future.

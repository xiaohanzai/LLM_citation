@Shao & Zhang 2017:
Cited to reference previous work that treated the host dispersion measure (DM) as a constant parameter or parameterized it tracing the star formation rate, highlighting the inappropriate assumption and the need for a more proper way to deal with host DM.

@Wei & Wu 2020:
Referenced to support previous work that calculated the dispersion measure of the intergalactic medium (DMIGM) using the mean matter density and introduced an uncertainty term to account for possible deviation from the mean, emphasizing the need to consider the non-Gaussian probability distribution of DMIGM.

@Lin et al. (2022):
Cited to mention the finding of no strong evidence for the correlation between host DM and star formation rate, indicating the need for further investigation on the constraints of photon mass.

@Macquart et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020:
These papers are cited to support the suggestion of considering the probability distribution and marginalizing over it when dealing with the host dispersion measure, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for the variability of host DM.

@Zhang et al. 2021b:
Referenced to mention the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations showing that the actual value of DMIGM may deviate significantly from the mean and the probability distribution is non-Gaussian, indicating the need for further investigation on the impact of the probability distribution of DMIGM on the constraints of photon mass.

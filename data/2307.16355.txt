@Niu et al. (2022):
Referenced to indicate the confirmation of FRB 20190520B being associated with a compact PRS.

@Kashiyama & Murase (2017); Metzger et al. (2017):
These papers are cited to suggest that compact PRSs could be key to understanding the origin of FRBs.
@Kashiyama & Murase 2017; Metzger et al. 2017:
These papers are cited to support the statement that compact persistent radio sources (PRSs) are important for investigating the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) both theoretically and observationally.

@Michilli et al. 2018:
Referenced to indicate that another repeating FRB, FRB 20201124A, was associated with a radio source, as revealed by the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).

@Wharton et al. 2021:
Cited to highlight the use of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in associating FRB 20201124A with a radio source.

@Ricci et al. 2021:
Referenced to indicate that the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) was also used to associate FRB 20201124A with a radio source, and that optical spectroscopy and radio interferometric measurements showed the source to be spatially extended and consistent with ongoing star formation activity.

@Ravi et al. 2022:
Cited to support the statement that optical spectroscopy and radio interferometric measurements demonstrated that the source associated with FRB 20201124A was spatially extended and consistent with ongoing star formation activity.

@Chibueze et al. 2022:
Referenced to indicate that a MeerKAT and e-MERLIN coordinated search led to another FRB-PRS association from FRB 20190714A, but it is uncertain if the radio emission could be attributed to ongoing star forming activity.

@Law et al. 2022:
Cited to state that no more FRB-PRS associations have been found with other localized FRBs, as mentioned in the references of Law et al. 2022.

@Nan et al. 2011:

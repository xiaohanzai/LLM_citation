@Spitler et al. (2016):
Referenced to establish that FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst (FRB) source found to repeat, ruling out certain progenitor models for FRBs.

@Chatterjee et al. (2017):
Cited twice, once to indicate that FRB 20121102A was the first FRB source to be precisely localized to a host galaxy, and again to note that it was the first FRB found to be co-located with a persistent radio source (PRS).

@Tendulkar et al. (2017):
Referenced to provide the redshift of the host galaxy of FRB 20121102A, which suggests a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts and super-luminous supernovae.
@Marcote et al. (2017):
Referenced to support the claim that the FRB and the PRS are located within 40 pc of each other based on VLBI observations with the European VLBI Network.

@Bassa et al. (2017):
Cited to highlight optical and far-infrared observations using the Hubble Space Telescope that revealed the slight offset of the FRB/PRS location from the centroid of a star formation knot within the host.

@Resmi et al. (2021):
Referenced to provide information about the flat spectral index of the PRS below 10 GHz.

@Mondal et al. (2020):
Cited to mention the possible turnover in the spectral index of the PRS at lower frequencies.

@Michilli et al. (2018):
Referenced to indicate that bursts from FRB 20121102A have high and variable Faraday rotation measure (RM).

@Hessels et al. (2019); Platts et al. (2021):
Cited to highlight the secular changes in the dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 20121102A.

@Murase et al. (2016); Margalit & Metzger (2018):
Referenced to present the plausible case for an FRB engine that is a young, highly magnetized neutron star embedded in an expanding supernova remnant and powering a pulsar wind nebula (PWN).

@Zhao & Wang (2021):
Cited to mention the alternative explanation that the FRB engine is within the vicinity of a massive black hole, with magnetar wind nebulae also discussed as the source of the persistent radio emission.
@Niu et al. (2022):
Referenced to mention the only other repeating FRB co-localised to a PRS currently known, providing context for the discussion of PRSs in relation to FRBs.

@Gaensler & Slane 2006:
Cited to suggest that if PRSs are wind nebulae, their limited lifespan could explain why only a subset of FRBs have a PRS counterpart.

@Law et al. (2022):
Referenced to support the estimation that PRS occurrence could be as high as 20% for repeating FRBs, based on a sample of 15 localised FRBs with radio sensitivity limits that could allow for PRS detection.
@Reines et al. (2020):
Referenced to support the identification of a sample of compact radio sources associated with dwarf galaxies and the suggestion that they may be intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), as well as to highlight the similarities between the compact radio sample and the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A.

@McConnell & Ma 2013; Reines & Volonteri 2015:
These papers are cited to provide background information on the prediction that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) could reside in dwarf galaxies.

@Eftekhari et al. 2020:
Referenced to discuss the connection between IMBHs, PRSs, and FRBs, and to highlight the preference for a magnetar progenitor in FRB models.

@Shimwell et al. 2022:
Referenced to describe the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) second data release, which is used as the radio reference catalogue in the study.

@Cook et al. 2019:
Referenced to describe the Palomar Observatory's 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope's 'Census of the Local Universe' (CLU), which is used as the optical reference catalogue in the study.

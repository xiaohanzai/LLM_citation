@Thornton et al. [6]:
Cited to acknowledge the discovery of several other similar radio pulses, which contributed to the increased attention and interest in FRBs within the astronomy community.

@[7][8][9]:
Referenced to highlight the identification of host galaxies and the direct measurement of redshift, confirming the extragalactic origin of FRBs.

@[10,11]:
Cited to indicate the number of FRBs that have been discovered so far, emphasizing the growing body of knowledge in this field.

@[12]:
Referenced to mention the confirmation of one FRB originating from our own Galaxy, distinguishing it from the majority of extragalactic FRBs.

@[14] and [15]:
Cited to acknowledge the observation of over one thousand bursts from two extremely active sources, FRB20121102A and FRB20201124A, providing examples of highly active repeating FRBs.
@16: Referenced to support the theoretical model of giant pulses from young rapidly rotating pulsars as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@17: Referenced to support the theoretical model of the black hole battery as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@18: Referenced to support the theoretical model of the "Cosmic Comb" as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@19, 20: Referenced to support the theoretical model of the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@21: Referenced to support the theoretical model of the neutron star-white dwarf binary as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@22: Referenced to support the theoretical model of the collision between neutron stars and asteroids as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@23, 24: Referenced to support the theoretical model of highly magnetized pulsars traveling through asteroid belts as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@25: Referenced to support the theoretical model of young magnetars with fracturing crusts as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@26: Referenced to support the theoretical model of axion stars moving through pulsar magnetospheres as a possible explanation for FRBs.
@12, 27: Referenced to support the claim that the recently discovered magnetar-associated burst in our Milky Way supports the magnetar origin of some, if not all FRBs.
@28, 29: Referenced to support the claim that the statistical similarity between repeating FRBs and soft gamma repeaters implies that they may have a similar origin.
@30, @31, @32, @33, @34, @35, @36, @37:
These references are cited to support the statement that FRBs can be used as probes to investigate cosmology and test fundamental physics.

@38, @39, @40, @41, @42:
These references are cited to support the statement that most FRBs have no direct measurement of redshift.

@43, @44, @45, @46:
These references are cited to support the statement that observed DM can be used as an indicator of distance to infer the redshift of FRBs.

@31, @35, @46:
These references are cited to highlight assumptions about the universality of host DM for all FRBs.

@47:
This reference is cited to highlight an alternative assumption about the correlation between host DM and the star-formation rate (SFR) of the host galaxy.

@48:
This reference is cited to present findings that contradict the assumption of a strong correlation between host DM and SFR from a limited sample of localized FRBs.

@36, @49, @50:
These references are cited to propose a more reasonable approach to dealing with host DM by modeling it using a proper probability distribution and marginalizing over free parameters.

@49:
This reference is cited to support the assumption that the host DM follows a log-normal distribution and to highlight the reconstruction of the DM-redshift relation from a small sample of well-localized FRBs.

N/A
@11: This reference is cited to indicate that the redshift of the first CHIME/FRB catalog is inferred using the DM-redshift relation.

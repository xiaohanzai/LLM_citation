Referenced to support the statement that most of the detected FRBs are of extragalactic origin, providing context for the discussion of the expected weakness and short duration of associated X-ray bursts from extragalactic magnetars.

@Yang et al. 2020:
Cited to support the statement that if FRBs are associated with X-ray bursts from extragalactic magnetars, then these X-ray bursts are expected to be very weak and short.

These papers are cited to support the statement that the bright and sharp peak of GRBs may appear in very short durations down to milliseconds.

@Song et al. (2022):

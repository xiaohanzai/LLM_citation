@Ref. [1]:
Cited to support the measurement of time delay distances using galactic lensing of quasars, which provides a Hubble constant measurement in tension with the Planck CMB measurements.

@Ref. [2]:
Referenced to provide the Hubble constant measurement from the Planck CMB measurements, which is in tension with the Hubble constant measurement from galactic lensing of quasars.

N/A
@3:
Referenced to support the claim that uncertainties in measurements of the lensing time-delays of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are limited by the wavelength of the light, potentially yielding nanosecond precision.

@4:
Cited to highlight that the remarkable precision of FRBs in measuring lensing time-delays will make them sensitive to stellar microlenses with typical time delays of order milliseconds.
@5,6:
These references are cited to support the statement that a substantial fraction of FRBs are observed to scintillate, which is relevant to the proposal of using scintillation of lensed images to measure cosmic expansion.

@7:
This reference is cited to highlight that a direct measurement of the Hubble constant to percent accuracy would be competitive with other local probes of cosmic expansion and would inform debates on the Hubble tension.

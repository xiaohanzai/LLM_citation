Referenced to support the suggestion of inferring the luminosity function of FRBs as a way to gain insights into their observables and compare them with other astrophysical events.

James et al. 2022a:
Cited to acknowledge the challenges in studying FRBs as a population, including the unknown number of distinct populations and the dominant progenitor channel.

Cui et al. 2021; Pleunis et al. 2021:
These papers are cited to highlight the possibility of repeaters and non-repeaters comprising two distinct populations of FRBs based on observational properties.
Marcote et al. 2020; Nimmo et al. 2022:
These papers are cited to provide examples of FRBs originating within star-forming regions and offset from the closest knot of local star formation, respectively.

Tendulkar et al. 2021:
Referenced to support the statement that repeaters have been shown to be offset by approximately 250 pc from the closest knot of local star formation.

Bhardwaj et al. 2021; Kirsten et al. 2022:
These papers are cited to highlight the surprising localization of the repeating FRB 20200120E to a globular cluster associated with M81, which is unexpected given that globular clusters host a much older stellar population than star-forming regions.

CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a; Bochenek et al. 2020; Kirsten et al. 2021:
These papers are referenced to mention the observation of FRB-like bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154.

Gohar & Flynn 2022:
Referenced to suggest the possibility that more FRB-like events occur in the Milky Way but remain undetected due to interstellar medium scattering.

Bannister et al. 2019; Heintz et al. 2020; Bhandari et al. 2020; Li & Zhang 2020; Mannings et al. 2021:
These papers are cited to support the statement that apparent one-off FRBs have been localized to host galaxies, including regions of low star formation rate.

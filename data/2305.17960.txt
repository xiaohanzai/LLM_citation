These papers are cited to highlight ongoing wide field-of-view and sensitive searches for FRBs with instruments such as ASKAP, CHIME, MeerKAT, and DSA, emphasizing the potential for a significant increase in the number of detected FRB events in the future.
@Platts et al., 2019:
Referenced to indicate that a multitude of progenitor models have been proposed to explain the mechanism(s) to produce FRBs.

@Bochenek et al., 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2020:
Cited to support the claim that leading models for FRBs invoke highly magnetised neutron stars (i.e. magnetars) resulting from the core-collapse of massive stars, with evidence from the association of the Galactic FRB-like source FRB 20200428 with the magnetar SGR 1935+2154.

@Chatterjee et al., 2017; Marcote et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2022:
These references are cited to provide further evidence for the association of particularly active repeating FRBs with star-forming regions or persistent radio sources.

@Kirsten et al., 2022:
Referenced to highlight the recent localization of the repeating FRB 20200120E to a globular cluster in the M81 galactic system, challenging the scenario of magnetars resulting from the core-collapse of massive stars.

@Duncan & Thompson, 1992; Rosswog et al., 2003; Tauris et al., 2013:
Cited to suggest that magnetars can also form from the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf or merger of compact stars in a binary system.
@Bhandari et al., 2020; Heintz et al., 2020; Mannings et al., 2021; Bhandari et al., 2022:
These papers are cited to support the statement that studies have identified a wide diversity in current FRB host galaxies, suggesting that the broader population of FRBs can arise from both young and (moderately) old progenitors.

@Mereghetti et al., 2021:
Referenced to highlight a nearby detection that provided useful upper limits on FRB counterparts at X-ray wavelengths.

Referenced to support the connection between FRBs and recent enhancement of star formation due to galactic interactions in the host galaxies NGC 3252, M81, and the Milky Way.

@Kaur et al. (2022):
Cited to support the similar conclusion about the H I-rich host galaxy of FRB 20180916B being involved in a recent minor merger.

These papers are mentioned to describe the fly's eye survey conducted at a Galactic latitude of |b| = 50 • ± 5 • as part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey on ASKAP, which led to the discovery of 20 FRBs.

@Lorimer et al. (2007); Petroff et al. (2019a); Cordes & Chatterjee (2019):
These references are cited to provide background information on fast radio bursts (FRBs), including their characteristics and unknown physical mechanism.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021):
Referenced to indicate the number of published FRBs in the past decade.

@Spitler et al. (2016); CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2019a,b); Fonseca et al. (2020); CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2020b, 2023):
These papers are cited to highlight the existence of repeating FRBs and the various studies that have reported them.

@Chatterjee et al. (2017); Ravi et al. (2019); Marcote et al. (2020); Macquart et al. (2020); Kirsten et al. (2022):
Referenced to emphasize the importance of localizing FRBs to their host galaxies for understanding their nature.

@Platts et al. (2019):
Cited to acknowledge the diversity of physical models for FRBs.

@Totani (2013); Mingarelli et al. (2015):
These references are cited to present different possibilities and physical models for FRBs, including cataclysmic scenarios and the role of black holes or neutron stars.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2020b); Rajwade et al. (2020); Cruces et al. (2021):
Referenced to highlight the observation of periodic activity windows in some FRB repeaters.

@Li et al. (2021); Lanman et al. (2022):
Cited to mention the clustering of bursts and the range of waiting times observed in some FRB repeaters.

@Pleunis et al. (2021):
Referenced to acknowledge the observed dichotomy between the morphology of apparent non-repeaters and repeater bursts.
@Lin et al. 2022(Lin et al. , 2023):
Referenced to support the assumption that apparently bright events are typically closer than faint events, based on the same luminosity function of FRBs.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a; Dong & CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2022:
Cited to provide examples of apparently bright bursts detected in the sidelobes of the CHIME/FRB telescope, highlighting the capability of detecting rare events in these regions.

@Petroff et al. 2019b:
Referenced to describe the detection of an apparently bright and low-DM FRB in the sidelobes of the Parkes telescope, and to mention the non-detection of repeating bursts, raising questions about the repetition behavior of FRBs.

N/A
@CHIME/FRB:
Referenced as the telescope that detected the 10 far side-lobe FRBs discussed in the paper.

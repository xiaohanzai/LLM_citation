@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020:
These papers are referenced to strengthen the connection between FRBs and magnetars, as the detection of FRB 20200428 was observed simultaneously with an X-ray burst emitted by the magnetar SGR1935.

These papers are referenced to provide information about the magnetar SGR1935, which is one of the most active known magnetars and was observed simultaneously with FRB 20200428.

@Bochenek et al. 2020; Margalit et al. 2020:
These references are cited to report the isotropic-equivalent energy emitted at radio wavelengths by the burst associated with SGR1935, which is relevant to understanding the energetics of FRBs.

These references are cited to support the statement that some FRBs have been observed in regions of star formation, which is consistent with the expectation that magnetars, connected to a young stellar population, could be progenitors of FRBs.

@Heintz et al. 2020; Mannings et al. 2021; Bhandari et al. 2022b:
These papers are referenced to highlight that some FRBs have been found in galaxies with low star formation rates, mainly in their outskirts, suggesting that magnetars may not be the only progenitor candidates for FRBs.

This reference is cited to report the discovery of the repeating FRB 20200120E in a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, which is relevant to the discussion of possible locations of young magnetised NSs.
@Tauris et al. 2013; Wang & Liu 2020:
These references are cited to support the theoretical possibility of finding young magnetised neutron stars (NSs) in globular clusters, formed through the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf (WD) or the collapse of a compact binary system induced by a WD-WD or WD-NS or NS-NS merger.

@Giacomazzo & Perna 2013; Schwab et al. 2016; Zhong & Dai 2020:
These papers are referenced to highlight the theoretical possibility of finding young magnetised neutron stars (NSs) in globular clusters, formed through the collapse of a compact binary system induced by a WD-WD or WD-NS or NS-NS merger.

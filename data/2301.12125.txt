These references are cited to support the claim that the brightness temperatures of radio pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs) are much greater than any plausible thermal temperature of the emitting electrons, suggesting that the radiation mechanism of these phenomena must be coherent.
@Melrose 2017; Zhang 2022a:
These references are cited to support the invocation of coherent emission mechanisms to interpret the emissions of radio pulsars and FRBs.

These papers are cited to discuss the proposal of coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches as an explanation for the emission of pulsars and FRBs.

These papers are cited to discuss the formation and radiation of charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a neutron star.

@Melrose 2017; Lyubarsky 2021:
These references are cited to highlight important issues with models involving charged bunches, such as their potential short-lived nature and the strong suppression of radiation by the magnetosphere plasma.

@Gil et al. 2004; Lyubarsky 2021:
These papers are cited to discuss the propagation and suppression of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below the plasma frequency in the highly magnetized plasma in the magnetosphere.

@Qu et al. 2023:
This reference is cited to support the finding that the plasma suppression effect could be ignored in the case of FRBs due to the existence of a parallel electric field in the FRB emission region.

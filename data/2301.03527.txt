These references are cited to provide examples of studies that have investigated the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and its relationship to the column density of electrons along the line-of-sight to the FRB.
@Andersen et al. 2020:
Referenced to acknowledge the possibility that some of the observed events might have a galactic origin.

@Zhou et al. 2014; Walters et al. 2018; Hagstotz et al. 2022; Macquart et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2022; James et al. 2022:
These papers are cited to support the proposal of using dispersion measure (DM) inferred from fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a cosmological probe, either through the average DM up to a given redshift or through the statistics of DM fluctuations.

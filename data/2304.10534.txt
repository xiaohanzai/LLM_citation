These references are cited to provide evidence and support for various aspects of the discussion, including the detection and periodic activity of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), the challenges of follow-up studies and host galaxy identification, the limitations of current technology in precise sky localization, and the identification of host galaxies for bright FRBs with low dispersion measure (DM) excess.
@Marcote et al., 2020; Nimmo et al., 2022; Kirsten et al., 2022:
These papers are cited to reference traditional approaches to VLBI for FRBs that have been implemented for repeaters, highlighting the challenges of localizing one-off FRBs with traditional VLBI techniques.

@Bannister et al., 2019; Ravi et al., 2019; Ravi & DSA-110 Collaboration, 2023; Rajwade et al., 2022; Law et al., 2020:
These papers are cited to mention the use of connected-element interferometers such as ASKAP, DSA-10, DSA-110, MeerKAT, and VLA for localizing apparently non-repeating FRBs, emphasizing the need for sub-arcsecond localizations of one-off FRBs on a routine basis for a large number of sources.

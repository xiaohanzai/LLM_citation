These references are cited to indicate the growing interest and research in the field of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their potential implications in astronomy and cosmology.

@8, @9, @10, @11, @12, @13, @14, @15, @16:
These references are cited to support the discussion on the dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs and its components, including contributions from the Milky Way, the Milky Way halo, the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the host galaxy, highlighting the importance of DM in FRB cosmology.
@17; @18; @19; @20:
These references are cited to support the statement that the plasma density fluctuates along the line of sight, leading to deviations in DM IGM from DM IGM for observed FRBs.

@8; @9; @10; @11; @12; @13; @14; @15; @16:
These references are cited to highlight the large uncertainty in DM IGM due to the poorly known IGM, which is one of the main challenges in FRB cosmology.

These references are cited to introduce the concept of extragalactic DM and its extensive use in studying cosmology.

@21: Referenced to support the statement that the luminosity distances of Cepheids can be obtained using the empirical period versus luminosity (P-L, or, Leavitt) relation.

@22: Cited to suggest that the empirical SNIa light-curve versus luminosity (Phillips) relation could be calibrated using SNIa at low redshifts.

@23: Referenced to indicate that the luminosity distances of SNIa at high redshifts can be obtained by extending the calibrated SNIa Phillips relation.

@24,25: Cited to propose that the luminosity distances of long GRBs at low redshifts can be obtained by using interpolation from the ones of SNIa at nearby redshifts.

@26: Referenced to suggest that various empirical relations, especially the E p, i -E iso (Amati) relation, could be calibrated using long GRBs at low redshifts.

@27: Cited to support the idea that the calibrated GRB empirical relation(s) can be extended to obtain the luminosity distances of long GRBs at high redshifts.

@28,29: Referenced to propose that the calibrated GRB empirical relation(s) can be used to obtain the luminosity distances of long GRBs at high redshifts.

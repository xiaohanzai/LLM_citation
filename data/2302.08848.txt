These references are cited to present an alternative suggestion that FRBs are generated in the wind or in the wind termination shock.

@Lyutikov & Popov, 2020:
Referenced to support the argument that observations of contemporaneous magnetar X-ray flares and FRBs strengthen the evidence for magnetospheric loci.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2022:
Cited to highlight the detection of sub-second periodicity in FRBs.

@Younes et al., 2022:
Referenced to support the consistency of the magnetospheric model with the recent detection of an anti-glitch in an FRB-associated magnetar.

@Lyutikov (2013):
Cited to provide further support for the magnetospheric model in the context of the recent detection of an anti-glitch in an FRB-associated magnetar.
@Lyutikov, 2006(Lyutikov, , 2015):
Cited to support the argument that the underlying mechanism causing magnetars' flares may be similar to those operating in the solar corona, based on the Solar flare paradigm for magnetar explosions.

@Thompson & Duncan, 1995:
Referenced to present an alternative view that magnetar flares are crustal events, contrasting with the Solar flare paradigm.
@Goldreich & Reisenegger, 1992; Gourgouliatos et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2014:
These references are cited to support the idea that the internal magnetic twist in magnetars is pushed into the magnetosphere via Hall drift and plastic deformations of the neutron star crust, leading to the gradual twisting of external magnetospheric field lines and the formation of active magnetospheric regions.

@Lyutikov, 2015:
Referenced to explain the slow, plastic deformations of the neutron star crust that gate the process of pushing the internal magnetic twist into the magnetosphere.

@Lyutikov, 2003; Komissarov et al., 2007; Ripperda et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020:
These papers are cited to support the idea that the loss of stability in the magnetosphere leads to a rapid restructuring of magnetic configuration, the formation of narrow current sheets, and the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic motion and radiation.

@Lyutikov, 2021:
Referenced to suggest that the coherent emission in magnetar flares may be produced by some kind of plasma instability, such as the Free Electron Laser mechanism.

@Palmer et al., 2005:
Cited to highlight the observed sharp rise of γ-ray flux during giant flares, which supports the magnetospheric origin of these events.

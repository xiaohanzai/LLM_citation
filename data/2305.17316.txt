@Younes et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2020):
Referenced to describe the anti-glitch that occurred in SGR J1935+2154 and the subsequent detection of three bright radio bursts by CHIME.

@Good & Chime/Frb Collaboration (2020):
Cited to report the detection of three FRB-like bursts by CHIME.

@Zhong et al. (2020):
Referenced to provide the distance of SGR J1935+2154.

@Ge et al. (2022):
Cited to discuss the timing properties of SGR J1935+2154 and the occurrence of a giant spin-up glitch before FRB 20200428.
@Haskell & Melatos 2015:
Referenced to support the statement that the origin of glitches in pulsars is still unknown, highlighting the need for further research on this phenomenon.

@Thompson et al. 2000; Lyutikov 2013; Tong 2014; Katz 2014; Huang & Geng 2014; Kantor & Gusakov 2014:
These papers are cited to present various proposed models for explaining the origin of anti-glitches, demonstrating the range of hypotheses that have been put forward on this topic.

@Katz 2014; Huang & Geng 2014:
Referenced to support the explanation of the anti-glitch observed in magnetar 1E 2259+586, suggesting that the accretion of planetesimals and the collision of a solid body with the magnetar could account for this phenomenon.

@Younes et al. 2023; Ge et al. 2022:
These papers are cited to establish a physical connection between the glitch/anti-glitch and FRB-like bursts observed in SGR J1935+2154, providing interpretations for the relationship between these events based on the escape of particle wind and the alteration of magnetospheric field geometry.

@Wang et al. 2022a; Wang et al. 2021; Tong 2023; Du 2023:
These papers are cited to reference other discussions on the glitch, anti-glitch, and glitch-associated activities of SGR J1935+2154, highlighting the existence of multiple perspectives on these phenomena but noting that none of them offer a comprehensive explanation for the simultaneous occurrence of anti-glitches, glitches, and FRB-like bursts.

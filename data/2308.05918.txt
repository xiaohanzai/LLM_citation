Referenced to provide the nearby value of the Hubble constant measured from Cepheid-calibrated type Ia supernovae, which shows a tension with the value inferred from Planck cosmic microwave background observations.

@Planck Collaboration et al. 2020:
Cited to provide the value of the Hubble constant inferred from Planck cosmic microwave background observations in the context of standard ΛCDM, which shows a tension with the nearby value measured from Cepheid-calibrated type Ia supernovae.

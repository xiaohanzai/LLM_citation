arXiv:2308.14387,Pavan A. Uttarkar et al.,Searching for the spectral depolarisation of ASKAP one-off FRB sources,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic transients of (sub-)millisecond duration that show wide-ranging spectral, temporal, and polarimetric properties. The polarimetric analysis of FRBs can be used to probe intervening media, study the emission mechanism, and test possible progenitor models. In particular, low frequency depolarisation of FRBs can identify dense, turbulent, magnetised, ionised plasma thought to be near the FRB progenitor. An ensemble of repeating FRBs has shown low-frequency depolarisation. The depolarisation is quantified by the parameter $\sigma_{\rm RM}$, which correlates with proxies for both the turbulence and mean magnetic field strength of the putative plasma. However, while many non-repeating FRBs show comparable scattering (and hence inferred turbulence) to repeating FRBs, it is unclear whether their surrounding environments are comparable to those of repeating FRBs. To test this, we analyse the spectro-polarimetric properties of five one-off FRBs and one repeating FRB, detected and localised by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. We search for evidence of depolarisation due to $\sigma_{\rm RM}$ and consider models where the depolarisation is intrinsic to the source. We find no evidence (for or against) the sample showing spectral depolarisation. Under the assumption that FRBs have multipath propagation-induced depolarisation, the correlation between our constraint on $\sigma_{\rm RM}$ and RM is consistent with repeating FRBs only if the values of $\sigma_{\rm RM}$ are much smaller than our upper limits. The observations provide further evidence for differences in the environments and sources of one-off and repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.14325,Zhao-Yang Xia et al.,Polarization Evolution of Fast Radio Burst Sources in Binary Systems,"Recently, some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been reported to exhibit complex and diverse variations in Faraday rotation measurements (RM) and polarization, suggesting that dynamically evolving magnetization environments may surround them. In this paper, we investigate the Faraday conversion (FC) effect in a binary system involving an FRB source and analyze the polarization evolution of FRBs. For an strongly magnetized high-mass companion binary (HMCB), when an FRB with $\sim100\%$ linear polarization passes through the radial magnetic field of the companion star, the circular polarization (CP) component will be induced and oscillate symmetrically around the point with the CP degree equal to zero, the rate and amplitude of the oscillation decrease as the frequency increases. The very strong plasma column density in the HMCBs can cause CP to oscillate with frequency at a very drastic rate, which may lead to depolarization. Near the superior conjunction of the binary orbit, the DM varies significantly due to the dense plasma near the companion, and the significant FC also occurs in this region. As the pulsar moves away from the superior conjunction, the CP gradually tends towards zero and then returns to its value before incidence. We also investigate the effect of the rotation of the companion star. We find that a sufficiently significant RM reversal can be produced at large magnetic inclinations and the RM variation is very diverse. Finally, we apply this model to explain some polarization observations of PSR B1744-24A and FRB 20201124A.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.12801,Shivani Bhandari et al.,Constraints on the persistent radio source associated with FRB 20190520B using the European VLBI Network,"We present very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of a continuum radio source potentially associated with the fast radio burst source FRB 20190520B. Using the European VLBI network (EVN), we find the source to be compact on VLBI scales with an angular size of $<2.3$ mas ($3\sigma$). This corresponds to a transverse physical size of $<9$ pc (at the $z=0.241$ redshift of the host galaxy), confirming it to be an FRB persistent radio source (PRS) like that associated with the first-known repeater FRB 20121102A. The PRS has a flux density of $201 \pm 34 \rm{\mu Jy}$ at 1.7 GHz and a spectral radio luminosity of $L_{1.7 \rm GHz} = (3.0 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1}}$ (also similar to the FRB 20121102A PRS). Comparing to previous lower-resolution observations, we find that no flux is resolved out on milliarcsecond scales. We have refined the PRS position, improving its precision by an order of magnitude compared to previous results. We also report the detection of a FRB 20190520B burst at 1.4 GHz and find the burst position to be consistent with the PRS position, at $\lesssim20$ mas. This strongly supports their direct physical association and the hypothesis that a single central engine powers both the bursts and the PRS. We discuss the model of a magnetar in a wind nebula and present an allowed parameter space for its age and the radius of the putative nebula powering the observed PRS emission. Alternatively, we find that an accretion-powered 'hypernebula' model also fits our observational constraints.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.12432,Evan F. Lewis et al.,The Petabyte Project,"Transient radio sources, such as fast radio bursts, intermittent pulsars, and rotating radio transients, can offer a wealth of information regarding extreme emission physics as well as the intervening interstellar and/or intergalactic medium. Vital steps towards understanding these objects include characterizing their source populations and estimating their event rates across observing frequencies. However, previous efforts have been undertaken mostly by individual survey teams at disparate observing frequencies and telescopes, and with non-uniform algorithms for searching and characterization. The Petabyte Project (TPP) aims to address these issues by uniformly reprocessing data from several petabytes of radio transient surveys covering two decades of observing frequency (300 MHz-20 GHz). The TPP will provide robust event rate analyses, in-depth assessment of survey and pipeline completeness, as well as revealing discoveries from archival and ongoing radio surveys. We present an overview of TPP's processing pipeline, scope, and our potential to make new discoveries.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2308.12118,DantÃ© M. Hewitt et al.,Dense Forests of Microshots in Bursts from FRB 20220912A,"We report on exceptionally bright bursts (>400 Jy ms) detected from the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20220912A using the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT), as part of the ECLAT (Extragalactic Coherent Light from Astrophysical Transients) monitoring campaign. These bursts exhibit extremely luminous, broadband, short-duration structures (~ 16 microseconds), which we term 'microshots' and which can be especially well studied in the NRT data given the excellent signal-to-noise and dynamic range (32-bit samples). The estimated peak flux density of the brightest microshot is 450 Jy. We show that the microshots are clustered into dense 'forests', by modelling them as Weibull distributions and obtaining Weibull shape parameters of approximately 0.5. Our polarimetric analysis reveals that the bursts are nearly 100% linearly polarised; have < 10% circular polarisation fractions; a near-zero average rotation measure of 0.10(6) rad/m^2; and varying polarisation position angles over the burst duration. For one of the bursts, we analyse raw voltage data from simultaneous observations with the Westerbork RT-1 single 25-m dish. These data allow us to measure the scintillation bandwidth, 0.30(3) MHz, and to probe the bursts on (sub-)microsecond timescales. Some important nuances related to dedispersion are also discussed. We propose that the emission mechanism for the broadband microshots is potentially different from the emission mechanism of the broader burst components which still show a residual drift of a few hundred MHz/ms after correcting for dispersion using the microshots. We discuss how the observed emission is phenomenologically analogous to different types of radio bursts from the Sun.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.11729,Katie Brown et al.,Validating the Sub-Burst Slope Law: A Comprehensive Multi-Source Spectro-Temporal Analysis of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts,"We conduct a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) utilizing nine distinct sources, the largest sample to date. Our data set includes 175 sub-bursts and 31 multi-component bursts from 11 data sets, with centre frequencies ranging from 149-7144 MHz and durations spanning from 73 \mu s-13 ms. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model (TRDM) of FRB emission. We affirm the predicted quadratic relationship between sub-burst slope and frequency, as well as a linear dependence of bandwidth on frequency that is consistent with mildly-relativistic Doppler broadening of narrow-band emission. Most importantly, we confirm the sub-burst slope law, a predicted inverse relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, to hold consistently across different sources. Remarkably, we also discover that the drift rates of multi-component bursts follow the same law as the sub-burst slopes, an unexplained result that warrants further investigation. These findings not only support the TRDM as a viable framework for explaining several aspects of FRB emission, but also provide new insights into the complex spectro-temporal properties of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.10930,Aaron B. Pearlman et al.,Multiwavelength Constraints on the Origin of a Nearby Repeating Fast Radio Burst Source in a Globular Cluster,"Since fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered, their precise origins have remained a mystery. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources provide one of the best ways to make rapid progress in our understanding of the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. We present results from a sensitive, broadband multiwavelength X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source. At a distance of 3.63 Mpc, FRB 20200120E resides in an exceptional location, within a ~10 Gyr-old globular cluster in the M81 galactic system. We place deep limits on both the persistent X-ray luminosity and prompt X-ray emission at the time of radio bursts from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible progenitors for the source. We compare our results to various classes of X-ray sources and transients. In particular, we find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with: ultraluminous X-ray bursts (ULXBs), similar to those observed from objects of unknown origin in other extragalactic globular clusters; giant flares, like those observed from Galactic and extragalactic magnetars; or most intermediate flares and very bright short X-ray bursts, similar to those seen from magnetars in the Milky Way. We show that FRB 20200120E is also unlikely to be powered by a persistent or transient ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) source or a young, extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries and models that require a synchrotron maser process from relativistic shocks to generate FRB emission. These results highlight the power that multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs can provide for discriminating between potential FRB progenitor models.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.10830,Anna Tsai et al.,Scintillated microlensing: measuring cosmic distances with fast radio bursts,"We propose a novel means of directly measuring cosmological distances using scintillated microlensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In standard strong lensing measurements of cosmic expansion, the main source of systematic uncertainty lies in modeling the mass profile of galactic halos. Using extra-galactic stellar microlensing to measure the Hubble constant avoids this systematic uncertainty as the lens potential of microlenses depends only on a single parameter: the mass of the lens. FRBs, which may achieve nanosecond precision on lensing time delays, are well-suited to precision measurements of stellar microlensing, for which the time delays are on the order of milliseconds. However, typical angular separations between the microlensed images on the order of microarcseconds make the individual images impossible to spatially resolve with ground-based telescopes. We propose leveraging scintillation in the ISM to resolve the microlensed images, effectively turning the ISM into an astrophysical-scale interferometer. Using this technique, we estimate a 6\% uncertainty on $H_0$ from a single observed scintillated microlensing event, with a sub-percent uncertainty on $H_0$ achievable with only 30 such events. With an optical depth for stellar microlensing of $10^{-3}$, this may be achievable in the near future with upcoming FRB telescopes.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2308.10258,Xiang-han Cui et al.,Fast radio bursts generated by coherent curvature radiation from compressed bunches for FRB 20190520B,"The radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been extensively studied but still remains elusive. Coherent radiation is identified as a crucial component in the FRB mechanism, with charged bunches also playing a significant role under specific circumstances. In the present research, we propose a phenomenological model that draws upon the coherent curvature radiation framework and the magnetized neutron star, taking into account the kinetic energy losses of outflow particles due to inverse Compton scattering (ICS) induced by soft photons within the magnetosphere. By integrating the ICS deceleration mechanism for particles, we hypothesize a potential compression effect on the particle number density within a magnetic tube/family, which could facilitate achieving the necessary size for coherent radiation in the radial direction. This mechanism might potentially enable the dynamic formation of bunches capable of emitting coherent curvature radiation along the curved magnetic field. Moreover, we examine the formation of bunches from an energy perspective. Our discussion suggests that within the given parameter space the formation of bunches is feasible. Finally, we apply this model to FRB 20190520B, one of the most active repeating FRBs discovered and monitored by FAST. Several observed phenomena are explained, including basic characteristics, frequency downward drifting, and bright spots within certain dynamic spectral ranges.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.08832,Pei Wang et al.,Atypical radio pulsations from magnetar SGR 1935+2154,"Magnetars are neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, frequently powering high-energy activity in X-rays. Pulsed radio emission following some X-ray outbursts have been detected, albeit its physical origin is unclear. It has long been speculated that the origin of magnetars' radio signals is different from those from canonical pulsars, although convincing evidence is still lacking. Five months after magnetar SGR 1935+2154's X-ray outburst and its associated Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20200428, a radio pulsar phase was discovered. Here we report the discovery of X-ray spectral hardening associated with the emergence of periodic radio pulsations from SGR 1935+2154 and a detailed analysis of the properties of the radio pulses. The complex radio pulse morphology, which contains both narrow-band emission and frequency drifts, has not been seen before in other magnetars, but is similar to those of repeating FRBs - even though the luminosities are many orders of magnitude different. The observations suggest that radio emission originates from the outer magnetosphere of the magnetar, and the surface heating due to the bombardment of inward-going particles from the radio emission region is responsible for the observed X-ray spectral hardening.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.08809,"Shuta J. Tanaka, Kazumi Kashiyama, ",Testing a stochastic acceleration model of pulsar wind nebulae: Early evolution of a wind nebula associated with SN 1986J,"Over three thousand pulsars have been discovered, but none have been confirmed to be younger than a few hundred years. Observing a pulsar after a supernova explosion will help us understand the properties of newborn ones, including their capability to produce gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts. Here, the possible youngest pulsar wind nebula (PWN) at the center of the SN 1986J remnant is studied. We demonstrate that the 5 GHz flux of 'PWN 1986J', increasing with time, is consistent with a stochastic acceleration model of PWNe developed to explain the flat radio spectrum of the Crab Nebula. We obtain an acceleration time-scale of electrons/positrons and a decay time-scale of the turbulence responsible for the stochastic acceleration as about 10 and 70 years, respectively. Our findings suggest that efficient stochastic acceleration and rising radio/submm light curves are characteristic signatures of the youngest PWNe. Follow-up ${\it ALMA}$ observations of decades-old supernovae within a few tens of Mpc, including SN 1986J, are encouraged to reveal the origin of the flat radio spectrum of PWNe.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.07044,Fabian SchÃ¼ssler et al.,Astro-COLIBRI: An Advanced Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics,"Observations of transient phenomena like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares and explosions (novae and supernovae), combined with the detection of novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has revolutionized astrophysics over the last years. The discovery potential of both ulti-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations as well as serendipitous observations could be maximized with a novel tool which allows for quickly acquiring an overview over relevant information associated with each new detection. Here we present Astro-COLIBRI, a novel and comprehensive platform for this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRI's architecture comprises a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system and a website as well as apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates incoming messages of astronomical observations from all available alert streams in real time, filters them by user specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context. The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena, provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of observatories around the world, and much more.   Here the key features of Astro-COLIBRI are presented. We outline the architecture, summarize the used data resources, and provide examples for applications and use cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, we'll discuss the use of the platform in searches for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2308.06816,Myles B. Sherman et al.,Deep Synoptic Array Science: Implications of Faraday Rotation Measures of Localized Fast Radio Bursts,"Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer the prospect of directly measuring extragalactic magnetic fields. We present an analysis of the RMs of ten as yet non-repeating FRBs detected and localized to host galaxies by the 110-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). We combine this sample with published RMs of 15 localized FRBs, nine of which are repeating sources. For each FRB in the combined sample, we estimate the host-galaxy dispersion measure (DM) contributions and extragalactic RM. We find compelling evidence that the extragalactic components of FRB RMs are often dominated by contributions from the host-galaxy interstellar medium (ISM). Specifically, we find that both repeating and as yet non-repeating FRBs show a correlation between the host-DM and host-RM in the rest frame, and we find an anti-correlation between extragalactic RM (in the observer frame) and redshift for non-repeaters, as expected if the magnetized plasma is in the host galaxy. Important exceptions to the ISM origin include a dense, magnetized circum-burst medium in some repeating FRBs, and the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of host or intervening galaxy clusters. We find that the estimated ISM magnetic-field strengths, $\bar{B}_{||}$, are characteristically larger than those inferred from Galactic radio pulsars. This suggests either increased ISM magnetization in FRB hosts in comparison with the Milky Way, or that FRBs preferentially reside in regions of increased magnetic-field strength within their hosts.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.06813,Myles B. Sherman et al.,Deep Synoptic Array Science: Polarimetry of 25 New Fast Radio Bursts Provides Insights into their Origins,"We report on a full-polarization analysis of the first 25 as yet non-repeating FRBs detected at 1.4 GHz by the 110-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) during commissioning observations. We present details of the data-reduction, calibration, and analysis procedures developed for this novel instrument. The data have 32 $\mu$s time resolution and sensitivity to Faraday rotation measures (RMs) between $\pm10^{6}$ rad m$^{-2}$. RMs are detected for 20 FRBs with magnitudes ranging from $4-4670$ rad m$^{-2}$. $9/25$ FRBs are found to have high ($\ge 70\%$) linear-polarization fractions. The remaining FRBs exhibit significant circular polarization ($3/25$), or are either partially depolarized ($8/25$) or unpolarized ($5/25$). We investigate the depolarization mechanism, disfavoring stochastic RM variations within a scattering screen as a dominant cause. Polarization-state and possible RM variations are observed in the four FRBs with multiple sub-components, but only one other FRB shows a change in polarization state. We combine the DSA-110 sample with polarimetry of previously published FRBs, and compare the polarization properties of FRB sub-populations and FRBs with Galactic pulsars. Although FRBs are typically far more polarized than the average profiles of Galactic pulsars, and exhibit greater spread in polarization fractions than pulsar single pulses, we find a remarkable similarity between FRB polarization fractions and the youngest (characteristic ages $<10^{5}$ yr) pulsars. Our results support a scenario wherein FRB emission is intrinsically highly linearly polarized, and where propagation effects within progenitor magnetospheres can result in conversion to circular polarization and depolarization. Young pulsar emission and magnetospheric-propagation geometries may form a useful analogy for the origin of FRB polarization.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.06805,Marcelo V. dos Santos et al.,The BINGO Project IX: Search for Fast Radio Bursts -- A Forecast for the BINGO Interferometry System,"The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO) radio telescope will use the neutral Hydrogen emission line to map the Universe in the redshift range $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$, with the main goal of probing BAO. In addition, the instrument optical design and hardware configuration support the search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this work, we propose the use of a BINGO Interferometry System (BIS) including new auxiliary, smaller, radio telescopes (hereafter \emph{outriggers}). The interferometric approach makes it possible to pinpoint the FRB sources in the sky. We present here the results of several BIS configurations combining BINGO horns with and without mirrors ($4$ m, $5$ m, and $6$ m) and 5, 7, 9, or 10 for single horns. We developed a new {\tt Python} package, the {\tt FRBlip}, which generates synthetic FRB mock catalogs and computes, based on a telescope model, the observed signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) that we used to compute numerically the detection rates of the telescopes and how many interferometry pairs of telescopes (\emph{baselines}) can observe an FRB. FRBs observed by more than one baseline are the ones whose location can be determined. We thus evaluate the performance of BIS regarding FRB localization. We found that BIS will be able to localize 23 FRBs yearly with single horn outriggers in the best configuration (using 10 outriggers of 6 m mirrors), with redshift $z \leq 0.96$; the full localization capability depends on the number and the type of the outriggers. Wider beams are best to pinpoint FRB sources because potential candidates will be observed by more baselines, while narrow beams look deep in redshift. The BIS can be a powerful extension of the regular BINGO telescope, dedicated to observe hundreds of FRBs during Phase 1. Many of them will be well localized with a single horn + 6 m dish as outriggers.(Abridged)",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2308.05918,"Jun-Jie Wei, Fulvio Melia, ",Investigating Cosmological Models and the Hubble Tension using Localized Fast Radio Bursts,"We use the dispersion measure (DM) and redshift measurements of 24 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to compare cosmological models and investigate the Hubble tension. Setting a flat prior on the DM contribution from the Milky Way's halo, $\mathrm{DM_{halo}^{MW}}\in[5,\;80]\;\mathrm{pc\;cm^{-3}}$, the best fit for flat $\Lambda$CDM is obtained with a Hubble constant $H_0=95.8^{+7.8}_{-9.2}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ and a median matter density $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}\approx0.66$. The best fit for the $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe is realized with $H_0=94.2^{+5.6}_{-6.2}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$. We emphasize that the $H_0$ measurement depends sensitively on the $\mathrm{DM_{halo}^{MW}}$ prior. Since flat $\Lambda$CDM has one more free parameter, $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ is favored by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with a likelihood of $\sim73\%$ versus $\sim27\%$. Through simulations, we find that if the real cosmology is $\Lambda$CDM, a sample of $\sim1,150$ FRBs in the redshift range $0<z<3$ would be sufficient to rule out $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ at a $3\sigma$ confidence level, while $\sim550$ FRBs would be necessary to rule out $\Lambda$CDM if the real cosmology is instead $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$. The required sample sizes are different, reflecting the fact that the BIC imposes a severe penalty on the model with more free parameters. We further adopt a straightforward method of deriving an upper limit to $H_{0}$, without needing to consider the poorly known probability distribution of the DM contributed by the host galaxy. The theoretical DM contribution from the intergalactic medium ($\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$) at any $z$ is proportional to $H_0$. Thus, requiring the extragalactic $\mathrm{DM_{ext}}$ to be larger than $\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$ delimits $H_0$ to the upside. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM, we have $H_0<89.0\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ at a 95\% confidence level.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2308.04298,L. Rhodes et al.,FRB 20121102A: images of the bursts and the varying radio counterpart,"As more Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are being localised, we are learning that some fraction have persistent radio sources (PRSs). Such a discovery motivates an improvement in our understanding of the nature of those counterparts, the relation to the bursts themselves and why only some FRBs have PRSs. We report on observations made of FRB 20121102A with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Across five epochs, we detect the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Our observations are split into a cluster of four epochs (MJD 58732 - 58764) and a separate single epoch about 1000days later. The measured flux density is constant across the first four observations but then decays by more than one-third in the final observation. Our observations on MJD 58736 coincided with the detections of 11 bursts from FRB 20121102A by the MeerTRAP backend, seven of which we detected in the image plane. We discuss the importance of image plane detections when considering the commensal transient searches being performed with MeerKAT and other radio facilities. We find that MeerKAT is so sensitive that within a two-second image, we can detect any FRB with a flux density above 2.4mJy at 1.3GHz and so could localise every FRB that has been detected by CHIME to date.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2308.00336,Jiaying Xu et al.,Blinkverse: A Database of Fast Radio Bursts,"The volume of research on fast radio bursts (FRBs) observation have been seeing a dramatic growth. To facilitate the systematic analysis of the FRB population, we established a database platform, Blinkverse (https://blinkverse.alkaidos.cn), as a central inventory of FRBs from various observatories and with published properties, particularly dynamic spectra from FAST, CHIME, GBT, Arecibo, etc. Blinkverse thus not only forms a superset of FRBCAT, TNS, and CHIME/FRB, but also provides convenient access to thousands of FRB dynamic spectra from FAST, some of which were not available before. Blinkverse is regularly maintained and will be updated by external users in the future. Data entries of FRBs can be retrieved through parameter searches through FRB location, fluence, etc., and their logical combinations. Interactive visualization was built into the platform. We analyzed the energy distribution, period analysis, and classification of FRBs based on data downloaded from Blinkverse. The energy distributions of repeaters and non-repeaters are found to be distinct from one another.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.16355,Xian Zhang et al.,Temporal and Spectral Properties of the Persistent Radio Source Associated with FRB 20190520B with the VLA,"Among more than 800 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only two, namely FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are confirmed to be associated with a persistent radio sources (PRS). Here we report evidence of apparent temporal variability in the PRS associated with the bursting FRB 20190520B based on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations taken in 2020 and 2021. Based on the analysis of epoch-to-epoch variability of the PRS at L, S, C, and X band in 1-12 GHz, we detected not only overall marginal variability but also a likely radio flux decrease between the observations taken in 2020 and 2021 at 3 GHz. Assuming no spectral variation in the PRS during these observations, we found the evidence for an overall broadband radio flux decrease by about 20 percent between the 2020 and the 2021 observations, suggesting that the PRS probably evolves on the yearly time scale. If we attribute the marginal variability at 3 GHz as intrinsic or due to scintillation, the size of potential variable component of the PRS is constrained to be sub-parsec. On the other hand, the size of the PRS can be also constrained to be larger than about 0.22 parsec from the averaged radio spectrum and the integrated radio luminosity in the 1-12 GHz band based on equipartition and self-absorption arguments. We discuss potential origins of the PRS and suggest that a scenario of accreting compact objects might be able to explain the temporal and spectral properties of the PRS. Confirmation of variability or flux decline of the PRS would be critical to our understanding of the PRS and its relation to the bursting source.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.16124,Weiwei Zhu et al.,A radio pulsar phase from SGR J1935+2154 provides clues to the magnetar FRB mechanism,"The megajansky radio burst, FRB 20200428, and other bright radio bursts detected from the Galactic source SGR J1935+2154 suggest that magnetars can make fast radio bursts (FRBs), but the emission site and mechanism of FRB-like bursts are still unidentified. Here we report the emergence of a radio pulsar phase of the magnetar five months after FRB 20200428. 795 pulses were detected in 16.5 hours over 13 days by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio telescope, with luminosities about eight decades fainter than FRB 20200428. The pulses were emitted in a narrow phase window anti-aligned with the X-ray pulsation profile observed by the X-ray telescopes. The bursts, conversely, appear in random phases. This dichotomy suggests that radio pulses originate from a fixed region within the magnetosphere, but bursts occur in random locations and are possibly associated with explosive events in a dynamically evolving magnetosphere. This picture reconciles the lack of periodicity in cosmological repeating FRBs within the magnetar engine model.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.15740,Claire S. Ye et al.,Single Millisecond Pulsars from Dynamical Interaction Processes in Dense Star Clusters,"Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky-Way-like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play the dominant role: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars; and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white-dwarf-binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.15294,Pawan Kumar et al.,Constraining the FRB mechanism from scintillation in the host galaxy,"We propose an observational test to distinguish between the two primary classes of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) radiation models. For an extended FRB source, the strength of spectral amplitude modulation caused by scintillation, which we refer to as the scintillation index, across the measured frequency band is much smaller than the 100% variations expected for a point source. FRB sources easily satisfy the point-source size requirement for scintillation from the Milky Way ISM plasma but may be large enough for certain classes of proposed FRB mechanisms to quench scintillation from plasma in the host galaxy. An FRB source of size smaller than the diffractive scale for scattering in the ISM of the host galaxy, which is about 10$^9$ cm at 1 GHz, would be considered point-like for the purpose of scintillation. The lateral size of the source for a magnetospheric origin of FRBs is expected to be $\lesssim 10^7$ cm, while it is $\gtrsim 10^9$ cm for far-away models, i.e., models in which the emission is generated far from the central engine. Therefore, scintillation in the host galaxy is well-suited for distinguishing between these two types of FRB models. Scatter-broadening of an FRB pulse by plasma in the host galaxy by $\delta t_s$ causes stochastic flux variation with frequency on a scale of $\sim (2\pi\delta t_s)^{-1}$. Determining the scintillation index for an FRB with scatter broadening identified to be from the host galaxy would provide a strong constraint on the FRB radiation mechanism. Since the scintillation bandwidth scales with frequency as $\sim \nu^{4.4}$, it may be observationally easier to determine the flux variation amplitude at a few GHz.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.14702,Lachlan Marnoch et al.,The unseen host galaxy and high dispersion measure of a precisely-localised Fast Radio Burst suggests a high-redshift origin,"FRB 20210912A is a fast radio burst (FRB), detected and localised to sub-arcsecond precision by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. No host galaxy has been identified for this burst despite the high precision of its localisation and deep optical and infrared follow-up, to 5-$\sigma$ limits of $R=26.7$ mag and $K_\mathrm{s}=24.9$ mag with the Very Large Telescope. The combination of precise radio localisation and deep optical imaging has almost always resulted in the secure identification of a host galaxy, and this is the first case in which the line-of-sight is not obscured by the Galactic disk. The dispersion measure of this burst, $\mathrm{DM_{FRB}}=1233.696\pm0.006~\mathrm{pc}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, allows for a large source redshift of $z>1$ according to the Macquart relation. It could thus be that the host galaxy is consistent with the known population of FRB hosts, but is too distant to detect in our observations ($z>0.7$ for a host like that of the first repeating FRB source, FRB 20121102A); that it is more nearby with a significant excess in $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$, and thus dimmer than any known FRB host; or, least likely, that the FRB is truly hostless. We consider each possibility, making use of the population of known FRB hosts to frame each scenario. The fact of the missing host has ramifications for the FRB field: even with high-precision localisation and deep follow-up, some FRB hosts may be difficult to detect, with more distant hosts being the less likely to be found. This has implications for FRB cosmology, in which high-redshift detections are valuable.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.13198,S. Q. Wang et al.,Change of rotation measure during eclipse of a black widow PSR J2051$-$0827,"Black widows are millisecond pulsars ablating their companions. The material blown from the companion blocks the radio emission, resulting in radio eclipses. The properties of the eclipse medium are poorly understood. Here, we present direct evidence of the existence of magnetic fields in the eclipse medium of the black widow PSR J2051$-$0827 using observations made with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We detect a regular decrease in rotation measure (RM) in the egress of eclipse, changing from $60\,\rm rad\,m^{-2}$ to $-28.7\,\rm rad\,m^{-2}$. The RM gradually changes back to normal when the line-of-sight moves away from the eclipse. The estimated line-of-sight magnetic field strength in the eclipse medium is $\sim 0.1$ G. The RM reversal could be caused by a change of the magnetic field strength along the line of sight due to binary orbital motion. The RM reversal phenomenon has also been observed in some repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), and the study of spider pulsars may provide additional information about the origin of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.12182,"Andrei M. Beloborodov, ",Damping of strong GHz waves near magnetars and the origin of fast radio bursts,"We investigate how a GHz radio burst emitted near a magnetar propagates through its magnetosphere at radii $r=10^7$-$10^9$ cm. Bursts propagating near the magnetic equator behave as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves if they have luminosity $L\gg 10^{40}$ erg/s. The waves develop plasma shocks in each oscillation and dissipate at $r\sim 3 \times 10^8 L_{42}^{-1/4}$ cm. GHz waves with lower $L$ or propagation directions closer to the magnetic axis do not obey MHD. Instead, they interact with individual particles, which requires a kinetic description. The kinetic interaction quickly accelerates particles to Lorentz factors $10^4$-$10^5$ at the expense of the wave energy, which again results in strong damping of the wave. In either regime of wave propagation, MHD or kinetic, the magnetosphere acts as a pillow absorbing the GHz burst and re-radiating the absorbed energy in X-rays. We conclude that a GHz source confined in the inner magnetosphere would be blocked by the outer magnetosphere at practically all relevant luminosities and viewing angles. This result constrains the origin of observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that observed FRBs come from magnetospheric explosions ejecting powerful outflows.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.09502,Tomas Cassanelli et al.,A fast radio burst localized at detection to a galactic disk using very long baseline interferometry,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, luminous radio transients of extragalactic origin. These events have been used to trace the baryonic structure of the Universe using their dispersion measure (DM) assuming that the contribution from host galaxies can be reliably estimated. However, contributions from the immediate environment of an FRB may dominate the observed DM, thus making redshift estimates challenging without a robust host galaxy association. Furthermore, while at least one Galactic burst has been associated with a magnetar, other localized FRBs argue against magnetars as the sole progenitor model. Precise localization within the host galaxy can discriminate between progenitor models, a major goal of the field. Until now, localizations on this spatial scale have only been carried out in follow-up observations of repeating sources. Here we demonstrate the localization of FRB 20210603A with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) on two baselines, using data collected only at the time of detection. We localize the burst to SDSS J004105.82+211331.9, an edge-on galaxy at $z\approx 0.177$, and detect recent star formation in the kiloparsec-scale vicinity of the burst. The edge-on inclination of the host galaxy allows for a unique comparison between the line of sight towards the FRB and lines of sight towards known Galactic pulsars. The DM, Faraday rotation measure (RM), and scattering suggest a progenitor coincident with the host galactic plane, strengthening the link between the environment of FRB 20210603A and the disk of its host galaxy. Single-pulse VLBI localizations of FRBs to within their host galaxies, following the one presented here, will further constrain the origins and host environments of one-off FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.08285,Jiaze Gao et al.,A Measurement of Hubble Constant Using Cosmographic Approach from Fast Radio Bursts and SNe Ia,"The Hubble constant ${H}_0$ is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, different cosmic observations have resulted in varying posterior results for ${H}_0$, leading to what is known as the ${H}_0$ tension. In order to address this issue, it is beneficial to use other dataset to constrain ${H}_0$. In this paper, via the cosmographic approach based on the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric to the dispersion measure of the intergalactic medium ${\rm{DM}}_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), we obtain the Taylor expansion of $\langle{\rm{DM}}_{\rm{IGM}}(z)\rangle$ in terms redshift $z$. The result for Hubble constant $H_0=65.5^{+6.4}_{-5.4}$ ${\rm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ $(68$$\%$ ${\rm{C.L.}}) $, cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.50\pm 0.20 $ and the jerk parameter $j_0=-0.1^{+2.0}_{-2.5}$ using uncalibrated Supernova Ia (SNe Ia) Pantheon dataset combined with 18 localized FRBs are obtained. To demonstrate the impact of parameter degeneracies on our analysis methods, we compare the results using three different forms of $f_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and two different prior distributions for $\Omega_{\rm{b,0}}$. Then we find that the uncertainty in $H_0$ is not significantly affected by the prior range of $f_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\Omega_{\rm{b,0}}$, but the mean value is influenced by the priors for $f_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\Omega_{\rm{b,0}}$ due to parameter degeneracies with $H_0$. Employing $f_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ that evolves with redshift, we obtain the constraints for $H_0=69.0^{+6.7}_{-5.7}$ ${\rm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$. Furthermore, the mock analyses give a posterior estimation of $H_0$ with an accuracy of 4.6\% and higher precision for $q_0$ and $j_0$ in the near future.",astro-ph.CO

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB$\,$20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB$\,$20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate SFR $\approx 8.9\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 4-6$ larger than optically-inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB$\,$20201124A has the most significant obscured star formation. While ${\it HST}$ observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed $\textit{in situ}$ (e.g., a magnetar central engine born from the explosion of a massive star). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB$\,$20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host, e.g., via a runaway massive star. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of $L_{\rm 6.0 \ GHz}$ $\lesssim$ 2.6 $\times$ $10^{27}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, two orders of magnitude below any PRS known to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of $\gtrsim 10^{5}$ yr in each model, respectively.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2307.06911,Thais Lemos et al.,Forecasting constraints on the baryon mass fraction in the IGM from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient events with a high energy and short duration in the radio frequency. By identifying the origin of the pulse, it is possible to measure the redshift of the host galaxy, which can be used to constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters and test aspects of fundamental physics when combined with the observed dispersion measure ($DM$). However, some factors limit the application of FRBs in cosmology: (i) the current poor modelling of the fluctuations in the $DM$ due to spatial variation in the cosmic electrons density; (ii) the fact that the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium ($f_{IGM}$) is degenerated with some cosmological parameters; (iii) the limited current knowledge about host galaxy contribution ($DM_{host}$). In this work, we investigate the impact of different redshift distribution models of FRBs to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM and host galaxy contribution. We use a cosmological model-independent method developed in previous work \cite{Lemos2023} to perform the analysis and combine simulated FRB data from Monte Carlo simulation and supernovae data. Since the physical mechanism responsible for the burst is still unknown, we assume four distribution models for the FRBs, namely gamma-ray bursts (GRB), star formation rate (SFR), uniform and equidistant (ED). Also, we consider samples with $N = 15$, 30, 100 and 500 points and three different values of the fluctuations of electron density in the $DM$, $\delta = 0, 10, 100$ pc/cm$^{3}$. Our analysis shows that the GRB, SFR and Uniform distribution models present consistent results within $2\sigma$ for the free parameters $f_{IGM}$ and $DM_{host,0}$ and highlights the crucial role of $DM$ fluctuations in obtaining more precise measurements.",astro-ph.CO

In this study, we present morphological properties of 60 FRB 20180916B bursts detected by CHIME/FRB between 2018 August and 2021 December. We recorded raw voltage data for 45 of these bursts, enabling microseconds time resolution in some cases. We studied variation of spectro-temporal properties with time and activity phase. We find that the variation in Dispersion Measure (DM) is $\lesssim$1 pc cm$^{-3}$ and that there is burst-to-burst variation in scattering time estimates ranging from $\sim$0.16 to over 2 ms, with no discernible trend with activity phase for either property. Furthermore, we find no DM and scattering variability corresponding to the recent change in rotation measure from the source, which has implications for the immediate environment of the source. We find that FRB 20180916B has thus far shown no epochs of heightened activity as have been seen in other active repeaters by CHIME/FRB, with its burst count consistent with originating from a Poissonian process. We also observe no change in the value of the activity period over the duration of our observations and set a 1$\sigma$ upper limit of $1.5\times10^{-4}$ day day$^{-1}$ on the absolute period derivative. Finally, we discuss constraints on progenitor models yielded by our results, noting that our upper limits on changes in scattering and dispersion measure as a function of phase do not support models invoking a massive binary companion star as the origin of the 16.3-day periodicity.",astro-ph.HE

We find that the far side-lobe events have on average $\sim$500 times greater fluxes than events detected in CHIME's main lobe. We show that the side-lobe sample is therefore statistically $\sim$20 times closer than the main-lobe sample. The median dispersion measure (DM) excess, after removing the Galactic disk component using the NE2001 for the free electron density distribution of the Milky Way, of the 10 far side-lobe and 471 non-repeating main-lobe FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog is 183.0 and 433.9 pc\;cm$^{-3}$, respectively. By comparing the DM excesses of the two populations under reasonable assumptions, we statistically constrain that the local degenerate contributions (from the Milky Way halo and the host galaxy) and the intergalactic contribution to the excess DM of the 471 non-repeating main-lobe FRBs for the NE2001 model are 131.2$-$158.3 and 302.7$-$275.6 pc cm$^{-3}$, respectively, which corresponds to a median redshift for the main-lobe FRB sample of $\sim$0.3.

We localize the bursts by fitting their spectra with a model of the CHIME/FRB synthesized beam response. CHIME/FRB did not observe repetition of similar brightness from the uniform sample of 10 side-lobe FRBs in a total exposure time of 35580 hours. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed bursts, we infer that the mean repetition interval above the detecting threshold of the far side-lobe events is longer than 11880 hours, which is at least 2380 times larger than the interval from known CHIME/FRB detected repeating sources, with some caveats, notably that very narrow-band events could have been missed. Our results from these far side-lobe events suggest one of two scenarios: either (1) all FRBs repeat and the repetition intervals span a wide range, with high-rate repeaters being a rare subpopulation, or (2) non-repeating FRBs are a distinct population different from known repeaters.",astro-ph.HE

Our sample includes seven well-localized FRBs with unambiguous host associations and existing deep Chandra observations, including two events for which we present new observations. We find evidence for AGN in two FRB host galaxies based on the presence of X-ray emission coincident with their centers, including the detection of a luminous ($L_X \approx 5 \times 10^{42} \ \rm erg \ s^{-1}$) X-ray source at the nucleus of FRB20190608B's host, for which we infer an SMBH mass of $\rm M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8} \ M_{\odot}$ and an Eddington ratio $L_{\rm bol}/ L_{\rm Edd} \approx 0.02$, characteristic of geometrically thin disks in Seyfert galaxies. We also report nebular emission line fluxes for 24 highly secure FRB hosts (including 10 hosts for the first time), and assess their placement on a BPT diagram, finding that FRB hosts trace the underlying galaxy population. We further find that the hosts of repeating FRBs are not confined to the star-forming locus, contrary to previous findings. Finally, we place constraints on associated X-ray counterparts to FRBs in the context of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and find that existing X-ray limits for FRBs rule out ULXs brighter than $L_X \gtrsim 10^{40} \ \rm erg \ s^{-1}$. Leveraging the CHIME/FRB catalog and existing ULX catalogs, we search for spatially coincident ULX-FRB pairs. We identify two ULX in the galaxy NGC 2633 that are spatially coincident with the repeating FRB20180908B and for which the DM-inferred redshift is comparable to the distance of the galaxy, assuming a $\rm DM_{host}$ contribution of $150 \ \rm pc \ cm^{-3}$.",astro-ph.HE

By associating FRBs to host galaxies, we can measure intrinsic and environmental properties that test FRB origin models, in addition to using them as precise probes of distant cosmic gas. The 110-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) is a radio interferometer built to maximize the rate at which it can simultaneously detect and localize FRBs. Here, we present the first sample of FRBs and host galaxies discovered by the DSA-110. This sample of 11 FRBs is the largest uniform sample of localized FRBs to date and is selected based on association to host galaxies identified in optical imaging by Pan-STARRS1 and follow-up spectroscopy at the Palomar and Keck observatories. These FRBs have not been observed to repeat and their radio properties (dispersion, temporal scattering, energy) are similar to that of the known non-repeating FRB population. Most host galaxies have ongoing star formation, as has been identified before for FRB hosts. In contrast to prior work, a large fraction (four of eleven) of the new sample are more massive than 10$^{11}$\ M$_{\odot}$ and most had elevated star formation rates more than 100 Myr in their past. The distribution of star-formation history across this host-galaxy sample shows that the delay-time distribution is wide, spanning from $\sim100$\,Myr to $\sim10$\,Gyr.

We report for the first time the RM value of PSR J1746$-$2850 to be $-12234 \pm 181$ rad m$^{-2}$. This pulsar shows significant variations of RM of $300-400$ rad m$^{-2}$ over the course of months to years that suggest a strongly magnetized environment. The structure function analysis of the RM of PSR J1746$-$2850 revealed a steep power-law index of $1.87_{-0.3}^{+0.4}$ comparable to the value expected for isotropic turbulence. This pulsar also showed large dispersion measure (DM) variation of $\sim 50$ pc cm$^{-3}$ in an event lasting a few months where the RM increased by $\sim 200$ rad m$^{-2}$. The large difference in RM between PSR J1746$-$2849 and PSR J1746$-$2850 despite the small angular separation reveals the presence of a magnetic field of at least 70 $\mu$G in the CMZ and can explain the lack of polarization in the radio images of the region. These results contribute to our understanding of the magnetic field in the CMZ and show similarities between the RM behaviours of these pulsars and some fast radio bursts (FRBs).",astro-ph.HE

Currently, there is little understanding about the classification of repeating FRBs, based on difference in physics, which is of great importance in understanding their origin. Recent works from the literature focus on using specific parameters to classify FRBs to draw inferences on the possible physical mechanisms or properties of these FRB subtypes. In this study, we use publicly available 1652 repeating FRBs from FRB121102 detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), and studied them with an unsupervised machine learning model. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model, we found that there is an indication for four clusters from the bursts of FRB121102 instead of the two clusters (""Classical"" and ""Atypical"") suggested in the literature. Wherein, the ""Atypical"" cluster can be further classified into three sub-clusters with distinct characteristics. Our findings show that the clustering result we obtained is more comprehensive not only because our study produced results which are consistent with those in the literature but also because our work uses more physical parameters to create these clusters. Overall, our methods and analyses produced a more holistic approach in clustering the repeating FRBs of FRB121102.",astro-ph.HE

The peaking dispersion measures of the left mode of the bimodal distributions increase with frequency, but the right one is inverse. The waiting times also present the bimodal distribution, peaking at 0.05622s and 1612.91266s. The peaking time is irrelevant to the properties of bursts, either for the preceding or subsequent burst. By comparing the statistical results with possible theoretical models, we suggest that FRB 180916.J0158+65 suffered from the plasma lensing effects in the propagation path.

We first investigate the properties of two one-off FRBs with periodic structures (i.e., FRB~20191221A and FRB~20210213A) in this scenario, by assuming the fast magnetosonic wave is responsible for their radio emission. For the luminosities and periods of these bursts, it is found that the pre-merger BNS with magnetic field strength $B\gtrsim 10^{12}\,{\rm Gs}$ is required. This is relatively high compared with that of the most of the BNSs observed in our Galaxy, of which the magnetic field is around $10^{9}\,{\rm Gs}$. Since the observed BNSs in our Galaxy are the binaries without suffering merger, a credited event rate of BNS-merger originated FRBs should be estimated by considering the evolution of both the BNS systems and their magnetic fields. Based on the population synthesis and adopting a decaying magnetic field of NSs, we estimate the event rate of BNS-mergers relative to their final magnetic fields. We find that the rapid merged BNSs tend to merge with high magnetization, and the event rate of BNS-merger originated FRBs, i.e., the BNS-mergers with both NSs' magnetic field being higher than $10^{12}\,{\rm Gs}$ is $\sim8\times10^{4}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ ($19 \%$ of the total BNS-mergers) in redshift $z<1$.",astro-ph.HE

The zDM code is used to model the probability of detecting this population as either apparently once-off or repeat events as a function of redshift, $z$, and dispersion measure, DM. I demonstrate that in the nearby Universe, repeating sources can contribute significantly to the total burst rate. This causes an apparent deficit in the total number of observed sources (once-off and repeaters) relative to the distant Universe that will cause a bias in FRB population models. Thus instruments with long exposure times should explicitly take repetition into account when fitting the FRB population.   I then fit data from The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). The relative number of repeat and apparently once-off FRBs, and their DM, declination, and burst rate distributions, can be well-explained by 50--100\% of CHIME single FRBs being due to repeaters, with $R_{\rm max} > 0.75$ day$^{-1}$ above $10^{39}$ erg, and ${\gamma_r} = -2.2_{-0.8}^{+0.6}$. This result is surprisingly consistent with follow-up studies of FRBs detected by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Thus the evidence suggests that CHIME and ASKAP view the same repeating FRB population, which is responsible not just for repeating FRBs, but the majority of apparently once-off bursts.   For greater quantitative accuracy, non-Poissonian arrival times, second-order effects in the CHIME response, and a simultaneous fit to the total FRB population parameters, should be treated in more detail in future studies.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2306.15505,F. Kirsten et al.,Connecting repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts via their energy distributions,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic, millisecond-duration radio flashes that reach Earth from extragalactic distances. Broadly speaking, FRBs can be classified as repeating or (apparently) non-repeating. It is still unclear, however, whether the two types share a common physical origin, differing only in their activity rate. Here we report on an unprecedented observing campaign that targeted one hyperactive repeating source, FRB 20201124A, for more than $2000~\mathrm{hr}$ using four $25-32\mathrm{-m}$ class radio telescopes. In total, we detect $46$ high-energy bursts, many more than one would expect given previous observations of lower-energy bursts using larger radio telescopes. We find a high-energy burst distribution that resembles that of the non-repeating FRB population, suggesting that apparently non-repeating FRB sources may simply be the rarest bursts from repeating sources. We also discuss how FRB 20201124A contributes strongly to the all-sky FRB rate and how similar sources would be observable even at very high redshift.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2306.13612,"Tomonori Totani, Yuya Tsuzuki, ","Fast radio bursts trigger aftershocks resembling earthquakes, but not solar flares","The production mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still a mystery, and correlations between burst occurrence times and energies may provide important clues to elucidate it. While time correlation studies of FRBs have been mainly performed using wait time distributions, here we report the results of a correlation function analysis of repeating FRBs in the two-dimensional space of time and energy. We analyze nearly 7,000 bursts reported in the literature for the three most active sources of FRB 20121102A, 20201124A, and 20220912A, and find the following characteristics that are universal in the three sources. A clear power-law signal of the correlation function is seen, extending to the typical burst duration ($\sim$ 10 msec) toward shorter time intervals ($\Delta t)$. The correlation function indicates that every single burst has about a 10-60% chance of producing an aftershock at a rate decaying by a power-law as $\propto (\Delta t)^{-p}$ with $p =$ 1.5-2.5, like the Omori-Utsu law of earthquakes. The correlated aftershock rate is stable regardless of source activity changes, and there is no correlation between emitted energy and $\Delta t$. We demonstrate that all these properties are quantitatively common to earthquakes, but different from solar flares in many aspects, by applying the same analysis method for the data on these phenomena. These results suggest that repeater FRBs are a phenomenon in which energy stored in rigid neutron star crusts is released by seismic activity. This may provide a new opportunity for future studies to explore the physical properties of the neutron star crust.",astro-ph.HE

Of the 98 unique X-ray sources identified in this study, 62 sources are within the optical field of view and, of those, 33% are aligned with an optical cluster counterpart. We find twenty X-ray sources coincident with globular clusters; two are previously discovered ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and eighteen are low mass X-ray binaries (GCLMXBs) with $L_X < 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. ULXs are a heterogeneous class of extremely bright X-ray binaries ($L_X > 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and ULXs located in globular clusters (GCULXs) and may be indicators of black holes. Identifying these unusually X-ray bright sources and measuring their optical properties can provide valuable constraints on the progenitors of gravitational wave sources. We compare observations of these sources to the twenty previously-studied GCULXs from five other early-type galaxies, and find that GCULXs in NGC 4261 are of similar colour and luminosity and do not significantly deviate from the rest of the sample in terms of distance from the galaxy centre or X-ray luminosity. Both the GCULX and low mass X-ray binary (GCLMXB) populations of NGC 4261 show long term variability; the former may have implications for fast radio bursts originating in globular clusters and the latter will likely introduce additional scatter into the low mass end of GCLMXB X-ray luminosity functions.",astro-ph.HE

Their transient X-ray emission usually manifests as short (a few hundred milliseconds), bright, energetic ($\sim$ 10$^{40-41}$ erg) X-ray bursts. Since its discovery in 2014, magnetar J1935+2154 has become one of the most prolific magnetars, exhibiting very active bursting episodes, and other fascinating events such as pulse timing anti-glitches and Fast Radio Bursts. Here, we present evidence for possible 42 Hz (24 ms) quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectrum peak energy (Ep) identified in a unique burst detected with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor in January 2022. While quasi-periodic oscillations have been previously reported in the intensity of magnetar burst lightcurves, quasi-periodic oscillations in the Ep have not. We also find an additional event from the same outburst that appears to exhibit similar character in Ep, albeit of lower statistical quality. For these two exceptional transients, such Ep oscillations can be explained by magnetospheric density and pressure perturbations. For burst-emitting plasma consisting purely of $e^+e^-$ pairs, these acoustic modes propagate along a highly magnetized flux tube of length up to around $L\sim 130$ neutron star radii, with $L$ being lower if ions are present in the emission zone. Detailed time-resolved analyses of other magnetar bursts are encouraged to evaluate the rarity of these events and their underlying mechanisms.",astro-ph.HE

Law, ",Detecting Fast Radio Bursts with Spectral Structure using the Continuous Forward Algorithm,"Detecting Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with frequency-dependent intensity remains a challenge, as existing search algorithms do not account for the spectral shape and might have resulted in non-detections. We propose a novel detection statistic, which we call the Kalman detector, that improves the sensitivity of FRB signal detection by incorporating spectral shape information. The detection statistic is based on an optimal matched filter, marginalizing over all possible intensity functions, weighted by a random walk probability distribution, considering some decorrelation bandwidth. Our analysis of previously detected FRBs demonstrates that the Kalman score provides a comparable yet independent source of information for bursts with significant spectral structure and the sensitivity improvement is of the order of 0-200%, with a median improvement of 20%. We also apply the Kalman detector to existing data from FRB 20201124A and detect two new repeat bursts which were previously missed. Furthermore, we suggest a practical implementation for real-time surveys by employing a low significance soft-trigger from initial integration-based detection algorithms. The Kalman detector has the potential to significantly enhance FRB detection capabilities and enable new insights into the spectral properties of these enigmatic astrophysical phenomena.",astro-ph.HE

The bent power-law (BPL) model, thresholded power-law (TPL) model and Band function are used to fit the distribution of energy, and the BPL model and exponential (EXP) model are used to fit the distribution of waiting time. It is found that no single model can fit the distribution of energy or waiting time well in the full range. To investigate the possible temporal evolution, we divide the full samples into several subsamples according to the observing sessions. We find that the distribution of energy for all subsamples can be well fitted by both BPL model and TPL model, while the distribution of waiting time for all subsamples can be well fitted by both BPL model and EXP model. Importantly, for the distribution of energy, the BPL index $\beta$ of all the subsamples is almost invariant, but the median value parameter $x_b$ varies significantly. Similar situation happens in the distribution of waiting time. Furthermore, for the distribution of waiting time, the occurrence rate parameter $\lambda$ in EXP model varies significantly. These features show that there may be a common emission mechanism for repeating FRBs, but the burst energy and occurrence rate are temporally evolving.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2306.05403,Khee-Gan Lee et al.,The FRB20190520B Sightline Intersects Foreground Galaxy Clusters,"The repeating fast radio burst FRB20190520B is an anomaly of the FRB population thanks to its high dispersion measure (DM$=1205\,$pc/cc) despite its low redshift of $z_\mathrm{frb}=0.241$. This excess has been attributed to a large host contribution of $DM_{host}\approx 900\,$pc/cc, far larger than any other known FRB. In this paper, we describe spectroscopic observations of the FRB20190520B field obtained as part of the FLIMFLAM survey, which yielded 701 galaxy redshifts in the field. We find multiple foreground galaxy groups and clusters, for which we then estimated halo masses by comparing their richness with numerical simulations. We discover two separate $M_{halo} >10^{14}\,M_\odot$ galaxy clusters, at $z=0.1867$ and $z=0.2170$, respectively, that are directly intersected by the FRB sightline within their characteristic halo radius \rvir{}. Subtracting off their estimated DM contributions as well that of the diffuse intergalactic medium, we estimate a host contribution of $DM_{host}=430^{+140}_{-220}\,$pc/cc or $DM_{host}=280^{+140}_{-170}\,$pc/cc (observed frame) depending on whether we assume the halo gas extends to $r_{200}$ or $2\times r_{200}$. This significantly smaller $DM_{host}$ -- no longer the largest known value -- is now consistent with H$\alpha$ emission measures of the host galaxy without invoking unusually high gas temperatures. Combined with the observed FRB scattering timescale, we estimate the turbulent fluctuation and geometric amplification factor of the scattering layer to be $\tilde{F} G\approx4.5 - 11\,(\mathrm{pc^2\;km})^{-1/3}$, suggesting most of the gas is close to the FRB host. This result illustrates the importance of incorporating foreground data for FRB analyses, both for understanding the nature of FRBs and to realize their potential as a cosmological probe.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2306.03886,Hao Qiu et al.,Systematic performance of the ASKAP Fast Radio Burst search algorithm,"Detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) requires software pipelines to search for dispersed single pulses of emission in radio telescope data. In order to enable an unbiased estimation of the underlying FRB population, it is important to understand the algorithm efficiency with respect to the search parameter space and thus the survey completeness. The Fast Real-time Engine for Dedispersing Amplitudes (FREDDA) search pipeline is a single pulse detection pipeline designed to identify radio pulses over a large range of dispersion measures (DM) with low latency. It is used on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) for the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) project . We utilise simulated single pulses in the low- and high-frequency observation bands of ASKAP to analyse the performance of the pipeline and infer the underlying FRB population. The simulation explores the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) recovery as a function of DM and the temporal duration of FRB pulses in comparison to injected values. The effects of intra-channel broadening caused by dispersion are also carefully studied in this work using control datasets. Our results show that for Gaussian-like single pulses, $> 85 \%$ of the injected signal is recovered by pipelines such as FREDDA at DM < 3000 $\mathrm{pc\ cm^{-3}}$ using standard boxcar filters compared to an ideal incoherent dedispersion match filter. Further calculations with sensitivity implies at least $\sim 10\%$ of FRBs in a Euclidean universe at target sensitivity will be missed by FREDDA and HEIMDALL, another common pipeline, in ideal radio environments at 1.1 GHz.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2306.02855,S. B. Zhang et al.,RRAT J1913+1330: an extremely variable and puzzling pulsar,"Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit sporadic radio bursts. We detected 1955 single pulses from RRAT J1913+1330 using the 19-beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). These pulses were detected in 19 distinct clusters, with 49.4% of them occurring sequentially with a waiting time of one rotation period. The energy distribution of these individual pulses exhibited a wide range, spanning three orders of magnitude, reminiscent of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Furthermore, we observed abrupt variations in pulse profile, width, peak flux, and fluence between adjacent sequential pulses. These findings suggest that this RRAT could be interpreted as pulsars with extreme pulse-to-pulse modulation. The presence of sequential pulse trains during active phases, along with significant pulse variations in profile, fluence, flux, and width, should be intrinsic to a subset of RRATs. Our results indicate that J1913+1330 represents a peculiar source that shares certain properties with populations of nulling pulsars, giant pulses, and FRBs from different perspectives. The dramatic pulse-to-pulse variation observed in J1913+1330 could be attributed to unstable pair creation above the polar cap region and the variation of the site where streaming pairs emit coherently. Exploring a larger sample of RRATs exhibiting similar properties to J1913+1330 has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of pulsars, RRATs, and FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2306.01877,"J. I. Katz, ",Periodically Modulated FRB as Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries,"The activity of at least one repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source is periodically modulated. If this modulation is the result of precession of the rotation axis and throat of an accretion disc around a black hole, driven by a companion that is also the source of accreted mass, then it may be possible to constrain the mass of the black hole. The dynamics is analogous to that of superorbital periods in ordinary mass-transfer binaries in which the accreting object may be a stellar-mass black hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf, but in the FRB source it may be an intermediate mass black hole. In a semi-detached (mass-transferring) binary the orbital period is related to the mean density of the mass-losing star. Assuming a value for its density and identifying the observed modulation period as a disc precession period would determine the mass ratio and the mass of the black hole. This model and magnetar-SNR models make distinguishable predictions of the evolution of the FRB rotation measure that may soon be tested in FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE

Assuming fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by matter travelling ultra-relativistically in a localised region of a smooth bundle of streamlines, we study the constraints applied by geometry to the morphology and polarisation of the burst in time and frequency independently of the intrinsic radiative process. Methods. We express the problem only in terms of the local properties of direction and curvature of a streamline. This allows us to cast the general results to any desired geometry. We illustrate by applying this framework to two geometries inspired by pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres, namely the dipolar polar-cap region and a magnetic dipole with an additional toroidal component. Results. Geometry constrains bursts to occur within an envelope in the frequency vs. time plane (dynamic spectrum). This envelope notably characterises spectral occupancy and frequency drifts (both burst-to-burst and within an individual burst). We illustrate how one can simulate bursts by specifying some basic properties of an intrinsic emission process. In particular we show that the typical properties of one-off bursts can be produced in polar-cap geometry by a star with spin period > 1s, while bursts from repeating sources are better accounted for with an additional strong toroidal component and a sub-second spin period. Conclusions. We propose that a relationship between burst morphologies and the properties of the source, such as its spin period and magnetospheric properties, can be established at least qualitatively based on geometrical considerations. Our results favour models where repeaters are younger and faster magnetars with highly twisted magnetospheres.",astro-ph.HE

However, their origin remains a highly debated topic in astronomy. Recent studies have argued for a possible association between the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 and FRB20190425A at a confidence level of 2.8$\sigma$. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived highly magnetized supramassive neutron star (SMNS) that formed after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. In this study, we investigate the proposed association, carefully considering the constraint that the FRB signal must traverse the high-density merger ejecta without experiencing noticeable attenuation to enable its detection at 400 MHz. Furthermore, we find that if the FRB is indeed linked to the gravitational wave event, the GW data strongly support a highly off-axis configuration, with a probability of the BNS merger viewing angle $p(\theta_v$ $>$ 30$^{\circ}$) to be $\approx$ 99.99%. Our findings therefore strongly exclude an on-axis system, which we find on the other hand to be required in order for this FRB to be detectable. Hence, we conclude that GW190425 is not related to FRB20190425A. We also discuss implications of our results for future detections of coincident multi-messenger observations of FRBs from BNS remnants and GW events and argue that BNS merger remnants cannot account for the formation of > 1% of FRB sources",astro-ph.HE

Forecasts for radio and optical surveys,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are the first cosmological radio sources that vary on millisecond timescales, which makes them a unique probe of the Universe. Many proposed applications of FRBs require associated redshifts. These can only be obtained by localizing FRBs to their host galaxies and subsequently measuring their redshifts. Upcoming FRB surveys will provide arcsecond localization for many FRBs, not all of which can be followed up with dedicated optical observations. We aim to estimate the fraction of FRB hosts that will be catalogued with redshifts by existing and future optical surveys. We use the population synthesis code frbpoppy to simulate several FRB surveys, and the semi-analytical galaxy formation code GALFORM to simulate their host galaxies. We obtain redshift distributions for the simulated FRBs and the fraction with host galaxies in a survey. Depending on whether FRBs follow the cosmic star formation rate or stellar mass, 20 to 40 per cent of CHIME FRB hosts will be observed in an SDSS-like survey, all at $z<0.5$. The deeper DELVE survey will detect 63 to 85 per cent of ASKAP FRBs found in its coherent search mode. CHIME FRBs will reach $z\sim 3$, SKA1-Mid FRBs $z\sim 5$, but ground based follow-up is limited to $z\lesssim 1.5$. We discuss consequences for several FRB applications. If $\sim1/2$ of ASKAP FRBs have measured redshifts, 1000 detected FRBs can be used to constrain $\Omega_\text{b} h_{70}$ to within $\sim10$ per cent at 95 per cent credibility.

We apply a set of criteria to exclude events which are susceptible to selection effect, but find that the excess at low redshift still exists in the remaining FRBs (which we call Gold sample).

We conducted a multi-wavelength observational campaign on FRB 20180916B between October 2020 and August 2021 during eight activity cycles of the source. Observations were led in the radio band by the SRT both at 336 MHz and 1547 MHz and the uGMRT at 400 MHz. Simultaneous observations have been conducted by the optical telescopes Asiago (Galileo and Copernico), CMO SAI MSU, CAHA 2.2m, RTT-150 and TNG, and X/Gamma-ray detectors on board the AGILE, Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL and Swift satellites.

In fact, the TNG/SiFAP2 observation simultaneous to a burst detection by uGMRT gives an upper limit E_optical / E_radio < 1.3 x 10^2. Another burst detected by the SRT at 336 MHz was also co-observed by Insight-HMXT.

We introduce here a novel method for a comprehensive analysis of active FRBs' behaviors in the time-energy domain. Using ``Pincus Index'' and ``Maximum Lyapunov Exponent'', we were able to quantify the stochasticity and chaos, respectively, of the bursting events and put FRBs in the context of common transient physical phenomena, such as pulsars, earthquakes, and solar flares. In the bivariate time-energy domain, repeated FRB bursts' behaviors deviate significantly (more random, less chaotic) from pulsars, earthquakes, and solar flares. FRB bursts wander in time-energy space stochastically, akin to Brownian motions. The high degree of stochasticity suggests complex and even multi-origins for FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

These two infrequent temporal coincidences between the glitch/anti-glitch and the fast radio burst (FRB)-like bursts reveal their physical connection of them. Here we propose that the anti-glitch/glitch and FRB-like bursts can be well understood by an asteroid tidally captured by a magnetar. In this model, an asteroid is tidally captured and disrupted by a magnetar. Then, the disrupted asteroid will transfer the angular momentum to the magnetar producing a sudden change in the magnetar rotational frequency at the magnetosphere radius. If the orbital angular momentum of the asteroid is parallel (or anti-parallel) to that of the spinning magnetar, a glitch (or anti-glitch) will occur. Subsequently, the bound asteroid materials fall back to the pericenter and eventually are accreted to the surface of the magnetar. Massive fragments of the asteroid cross magnetic field lines and produce bright radio bursts through coherent curvature radiation. Our model can explain the sudden magnetar spin changes and FRB-like bursts in a unified way.",astro-ph.HE

This collaboration between the CRAFT and WALLABY survey teams marks the fifth, and most distant, FRB host galaxy detected in HI, not including the Milky Way.

The HI global spectrum of W13-18 appears to be asymmetric, albeit the HI observation has a low S/N, and the galaxy itself appears modestly undisturbed. These properties are compared to the early literature of HI emission detected in other FRB hosts to date, where either the HI global spectra were strongly asymmetric, or there were clearly disrupted HI intensity map distributions. W13-18 lacks sufficient S/N to determine whether it is significantly less asymmetric in its HI distribution than previous examples of FRB host galaxies.

Here we discuss formation of these young pulsars through white dwarf mergers in dynamically-old clusters that have undergone core collapse. Based on observed properties of magnetic white dwarfs, we argue neutron stars formed via white dwarf merger are born with spin periods of roughly $10-100\,$ms and magnetic fields of roughly $10^{11}-10^{13}\,$G. As these neutron stars spin down via magnetic dipole radiation, they naturally reproduce the four observed young pulsars in the Milky Way clusters. Rates inferred from $N$-body cluster simulations as well as the binarity, host cluster properties, and cluster offsets observed for these young pulsars hint further at a white dwarf merger origin. These young pulsars may be descendants of neutron stars capable of powering fast radio bursts analogous to the bursts observed recently in a globular cluster in M81.",astro-ph.HE

Measurements of characteristic scattering times alone are insufficient to constrain the position of the dominant scattering media along the line of sight. However, where more than one scattering screen exists, Galactic scintillation can be leveraged to form strong constraints. We quantify the scattering and scintillation in 10 FRBs with 1) known host galaxies and redshifts and 2) captured voltage data enabling high-time resolution analysis. We find strong evidence for two screens in three cases. For FRBs 20190608B and 20210320C, we find evidence for scattering screens less than approximately 16.7 and 3000 kpc respectively, from their sources, consistent with the scattering occurring in the circum-burst environment, the host ISM (inter-stellar medium) or the CGM. For FRB 20201124A we find a low modulation index that evolves over the burst's scattering tail, indicating the presence of a scattering screen $\approx9$ kpc from the host, and excluding the circum-burst environment from potential scattering sites. By assuming that pulse broadening is contributed by the host galaxy ISM or circum-burst environment, the lack of observed scintillation in four FRBs in our sample suggests that existing models may be poor estimators of scattering times associated with the Milky Way's ISM, similar to the anomalously low scattering observed for FRB 20201124A.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2305.11302,Bridget C. Andersen et al.,Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients of micro-to-millisecond duration and unknown extragalactic origin. Central to the mystery of FRBs are their extremely high characteristic energies, which surpass the typical energies of other radio transients of similar duration, like Galactic pulsar and magnetar bursts, by orders of magnitude. Calibration of FRB-detecting telescopes for burst flux and fluence determination is crucial for FRB science, as these measurements enable studies of the FRB energy and brightness distribution in comparison to progenitor theories. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a radio interferometer of cylindrical design. This design leads to a high FRB detection rate but also leads to challenges for CHIME/FRB flux calibration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these challenges, as well as the automated flux calibration software pipeline that was developed to calibrate bursts detected in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, consisting of 536 events detected between July 25th, 2018 and July 1st, 2019. We emphasize that, due to limitations in the localization of CHIME/FRB bursts, flux and fluence measurements produced by this pipeline are best interpreted as lower limits, with uncertainties on the limiting value.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2305.09428,G. Principe et al.,Hunting for gamma-ray emission from Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a recently discovered class of GHz-band, ms-duration, Jy-level-flux astrophysical transients, which origin is still a mystery. Exploring their gamma-ray counterpart is crucial for constraining their origin and emission mechanism. Thanks to more than 13 years of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope, and to more than 1000 FRB events, one of the largest sample created as of today, we perform the largest and deepest search for gamma-ray emission from FRB sources to date. In addition to the study of individual FRB events on different time-scales (from few seconds up to several years), we performed, for the first time, a stacking analysis on the full sample of FRB events as well as a search for triplet photons in coincidence with the radio event. We do not detect significant emission, reporting the most stringent constraints, on short time scales, for the FRB-like emission from SGR 1935+2154 with $E<10^{41}$ erg, corresponding to a factor $<10^7$ with respect to the emitted radio energy. For the stacked signal of steady emission from all repeaters, the obtained upper limit (UL) on the FRBs luminosity ($L<1.6\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is more than two orders of magnitudes lower than those derived from the individual sources. Finally, no individual or triplet photons have been significantly associated with FRB events. We derived the LAT ms energy sensitivity to be $E<10^{47}$ (D$_L$/150 Mpc)$^2$ erg, ruling out a gamma-ray-to-radio energy ratio greater than $10^9$ on ms timescales. The results reported here represent the most stringent UL reported so far on the high-energy emission from FRBs on short and long time scales, as well as on cumulative emission and individual photon searches. While the origin of FRBs is still unclear, our work provides important constraints for FRB modeling, which might shed light on their emission mechanism.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2305.08649,"Yuan-Pei Yang, ",Implications of Narrow Spectra of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients with extremely high brightness temperatures at cosmological distances, and the physical origin and the radiation mechanism of FRBs are still unknown. The observed spectral bandwidth of some FRBs appeared narrow compared with their peak frequencies, which could be used to constrain the radiation mechanism and the astrophysical environment of FRBs. In this work, we investigate some possible physical origins of the narrow spectra from the perspectives of intrinsic radiation mechanisms, coherent processes, radiative transfers, and interference processes. We find that: (1) If the observed narrow spectra of FRBs are attributed to the intrinsic radiation mechanism by a single charged particle, the particle's deflection angle should be much smaller than the radiation beaming angle. (2) Coherent process can make cause narrow spectra. For the bunching mechanism, the narrow spectra might arise from the radiating bunches with a quasi-periodic distribution. For the maser mechanism, the negative absorption process can naturally cause a narrow spectrum. (3) Most absorption and scattering processes do not significantly change the observed spectra based on the current observation of some FRB repeaters. (4) Scintillation and plasma lensing in the FRB source environment can modulate the spectra, leading to narrow spectra and the burst-to-burst variation of spectra. A planet-like object can generate spectral modulation via gravitational lensing at the GHz band, but the observed burst-to-burst variation of the spectra does not support this scenario.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2305.07022,Jay Baptista et al.,Measuring the Variance of the Macquart Relation in z-DM Modeling,"The Macquart relation describes the correlation between the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the redshift $z$ of their host galaxies. The scatter of the Macquart relation is sensitive to the distribution of baryons in the intergalactic medium (IGM) including those ejected from galactic halos through feedback processes. The width of the distribution in DMs from the cosmic web (${\rm DM}_{\rm cosmic}$) is parameterized by a fluctuation parameter $F$, which is related to the cosmic DM variance by $\sigma_{\rm DM}= F z^{-0.5}$. In this work, we present a new measurement of $F$ using 78 FRBs of which 21 have been localized to host galaxies. Our analysis simultaneously fits for the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the DM distribution due to the FRB host galaxy. We find that the fluctuation parameter is degenerate with these parameters, most notably $H_0$, and use a uniform prior on $H_0$ to measure $\log_{10} F > -0.89$ at the $3\sigma$ confidence interval and a new constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0 = 85.3_{-8.1}^{+9.4} \, {\rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}}$. Using a synthetic sample of 100 localized FRBs, the constraint on the fluctuation parameter is improved by a factor of $\sim 2$. Comparing our $F$ measurement to simulated predictions from cosmological simulation (IllustrisTNG), we find agreement between $0.4 < z < 2$. However, at $z < 0.4$, the simulations underpredict $F$ which we attribute to the rapidly changing extragalactic DM excess distribution at low redshift.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2305.06393,A. Gopinath et al.,Propagation effects at low frequencies seen in the LOFAR long-term monitoring of the periodically active FRB 20180916B,"LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) has previously detected bursts from the periodically active, repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20180916B down to unprecedentedly low radio frequencies of 110 MHz. Here we present 11 new bursts in 223 more hours of continued monitoring of FRB 20180916B in the 110-188 MHz band with LOFAR. We place new constraints on the source's activity window $w = 4.3^{+0.7}_{-0.2}$ day, and phase centre $\phi_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{LOFAR}} = 0.67^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ in its 16.33-day activity cycle, strengthening the evidence for its frequency-dependent activity cycle. Propagation effects like Faraday rotation and scattering are especially pronounced at low frequencies and constrain properties of FRB 20180916B's local environment. We track variations in scattering and time-frequency drift rates, and find no evidence for trends in time or activity phase. Faraday rotation measure (RM) variations seen between June 2021 and August 2022 show a fractional change $>$50% with hints of flattening of the gradient of the previously reported secular trend seen at 600 MHz. The frequency-dependent window of activity at LOFAR appears stable despite the significant changes in RM, leading us to deduce that these two effects have different causes. Depolarization of and within individual bursts towards lower radio frequencies is quantified using LOFAR's large fractional bandwidth, with some bursts showing no detectable polarization. However, the degree of depolarization seems uncorrelated to the scattering timescales, allowing us to evaluate different depolarization models. We discuss these results in the context of models that invoke rotation, precession, or binary orbital motion to explain the periodic activity of FRB 20180916B.",astro-ph.HE

We briefly review the first set of results of this program to study transient phenomena, such as magnetars and glitching pulsars, as well as to perform precise timing of millisecond pulsars. Access to lower frequency bands, where most of the pulsars are brighter, would allow us to reach additional pulsars, currently buried into the background noise. We identify two dozen additional glitching pulsars that could be observable in the 400MHz band by the IAR's projected Multipurpose Interferometer Array (MIA). We also discuss the relevance and challenges of single-pulse pulsar timing at low frequencies and the search for Fast Radio Burst (FRB) in the collected data since 2017 using machine learning techniques.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2305.04738,Yanqi Du et al.,Scaling and Universality in the Temporal Occurrence of Repeating FRBs,"The dynamics of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are driven by their physical nature and central engine, however their event rate, energy distribution and temporal occurrence behaviour are still remain uncertain due to the server lack of information of bursts. Recently, the available of high-frequency observation data for the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has made it possible to statistically study the temporal occurrence on timescales from several milliseconds to over several thousand seconds. In this research we studied both the FRB121102 and FRB20201124A temporal occurrence and report here a statistical result about the behaviour of the waiting time (or recurrence-time) between successive bursts. The results exhibit novel scaling and universality which have not reported in the field yet. Specifically, we find the scaling law for FRBs recurrence-time distribution which is a clear indication of the importance of correlations in the structure of its physical nature and central engine. The scaling relationships were observed for time scales spanning three orders of magnitude. Given that they are sharing the same scaling law between two repeating FRBs, we infer that the scaling law of waiting time distribution should acts as a indicator which provides insights into the physical nature and the development of the central engine model.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2305.02598,Fen Lyu et al.,Confining Burst Energy Function and Spectral Fringe Pattern of FRB 20121102A with Multifrequency Observations,"The observed spectral shapes variation and tentative bimodal burst energy distribution (E-distribution) of fast radio burst (FRB) 20121102A with the FAST telescope are great puzzles. Adopting the published multifrequency data observed with the FAST and Arecibo telescopes at $L$ band and the GBT telescope at $C$ band, we investigate these puzzles through Monte Carlo simulations. The intrinsic energy function (E-function) is modeled as $dp/dE\propto E^{-\alpha_{\rm E}}$, and the spectral profile is described as a Gaussian function. A fringe pattern of its spectral peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm p}$) in 0.5-8 GHz is inferred from the $\nu_{\rm p}$ distribution of the GBT sample. We estimate the likelihood of $\alpha_{\rm E}$ and the standard deviation of the spectral profile ($\sigma_{\rm s}$) by utilizing the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K-S) test probability for the observed and simulated specific E-distributions. Our simulations yields $\alpha_{\rm E}=1.82^{+0.10}_{-0.30}$ and $\sigma_{\rm s}=0.18^{+0.28}_{-0.06}$ ($3\sigma$ confidence level) with the FAST sample. These results suggest that a single power-law function is adequate to model the E-function of FRB 20121102A. The variations of its observed spectral indices and E-distributions with telescopes in different frequency ranges are due to both physical and observational reasons, i.e. narrow spectral width for a single burst and discrete $\nu_{p}$ fringe pattern in a broad frequency range among bursts, and the selection effects of the telescope bandpass and sensitivity. The putative $\nu_{p}$ fringe pattern cannot be explained with the current radiation physics models of FRBs. Some caveats of possible artificial effects that may introduce such a feature are discussed.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2305.00992,Boryana Hadzhiyska et al.,Interpreting Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with MillenniumTNG: Mass and environment scaling relations,"In the coming years, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) measurements can dramatically improve our understanding of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and the role of feedback processes on galaxy formation, allowing us to calibrate important astrophysical systematics in cosmological constraints from weak lensing galaxy clustering surveys. However, the signal is only measured in a two-dimensional projection, and its correct interpretation relies on understanding the connection between observable quantities and the underlying intrinsic properties of the gas, in addition to the relation between the gas and the underlying matter distribution. One way to address these challenges is through the use of hydrodynamical simulations such as the high-resolution, large-volume MillenniumTNG suite. We find that measurements of the optical depth, $\tau$, and the Compton-y parameter, $Y$, receive large line-of-sight contributions which can be removed effectively by applying a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter. In contrast with other $\tau$ probes (e.g., X-rays and Fast Radio Bursts), the kSZ-inferred $\tau$ receives most of its signal from a confined cylindrical region around the halo due to the velocity decorrelation along the line-of-sight. Additionally, we perform fits to the $Y-M$ and $\tau-M$ scaling relations and report best-fit parameters adopting the smoothly broken power law (SBPL) formalism. We note that subgrid physics modeling can broaden the error bar on these by 30\% for intermediate-mass halos ($\sim$$10^{13} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$). The scatter of the scaling relations can be captured by an intrinsic dependence on concentration, and an extrinsic dependence on tidal shear. Finally, we comment on the effect of using galaxies rather than halos in real observations, which can bias the inferred SZ profiles by $\sim$20\% for $L_\ast$-galaxies.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2304.14784,Bao Wang et al.,Revisiting constraints on the photon rest mass with cosmological fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been suggested as an excellent celestial laboratory for testing the zero-mass hypothesis of the photon. In this work, we use the dispersion measure (DM)--redshift measurements of 23 localized FRBs to revisit the photon rest mass $m_{\gamma}$. As an improvement over previous studies, here we take into account the more realistic probability distributions of DMs contributed by the FRB host galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) from the IllustrisTNG simulation. To better account for the systematic uncertainty induced by the choices of priors of cosmological parameters, we also combine the FRB data with the cosmic microwave background data, the baryon acoustic oscillation data, and type Ia supernova data to constrain the cosmological parameters and $m_{\gamma}$ simultaneously. We derive a new upper limit of $m_{\gamma}\le3.8\times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma}\le2.1 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 7.2 \times 10^{-51} \, \rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma}\le4.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm{eV/c^2}$) at $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. Meanwhile, our analysis can also lead to a reasonable estimation for the IGM baryon fraction $f_{\rm IGM}=0.873^{+0.061}_{-0.050}$. With the number increment of localized FRBs, the constraints on both $m_{\gamma}$ and $f_{\rm IGM}$ will be further improved. A caveat of constraining $m_{\gamma}$ within the context of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is also discussed.",astro-ph.HE

We detect a scintillation arc in the FRB's secondary spectrum, which describes the power in terms of the scattered FRB signals' time delay and Doppler shift. The arc indicates that the scintillation is caused by a highly localized region of the ionized interstellar medium (IISM). Our analysis favors a Milky Way origin for the localized scattering medium but cannot rule out a host galaxy origin. We present our method for detecting the scintillation arc, which can be applied generally to sources with irregularly spaced bursts or pulses. These methods could help shed light on the complex interstellar environment surrounding the FRBs and in our Galaxy.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.14671,Yi Feng et al.,An extreme active repeating fast radio burst in a clean environment,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio bursts at cosmological distances. Only three FRBs have exhibited extreme activities, such as achieving a peak event rate $\gtrsim 100$ hr$^{-1}$ or being persistently active. Only these three among $\sim 50$ known repeating FRBs have circular polarization. We observed the FRB 20220912A with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at L-band on 24 October 2022 and detected 128 bursts in 1.4 hours, corresponding to a burst rate of about 90 hr$^{-1}$, which is the highest yet for FRBs observed by the GBT and makes it the fourth extremely active FRB. The median energy of the bursts is $4.0\times10^{37}$ erg, close to the characteristic energy of FRB 20121102A. The average rotation measure (RM) was $-$0.4 rad m$^{-2}$ with unnoticeable intraday RM change, indicating a likely clean environment, in contrast to the other three extremely active repeating FRBs. Most bursts have nearly 100% linear polarization. Approximately 56% of the bright bursts have circular polarization, the highest such fraction among all FRBs. A downward drift in frequency and polarization angle swings were found in our sample. The discovery and characterization of FRB 20220912A support the view that the downward drift in frequency, polarization angle swings, and circular polarization are intrinsic to radiation physics, which may be shared by active repeaters regardless of the environments.",astro-ph.HE

We conducted 17 observations totaling 8.67 hours and detected a total of 1076 bursts with an event rate up to 390 hr$^{-1}$. The cumulative energy distribution can be well described using a broken power-law function with the lower and higher-energy slopes of $-0.38\pm0.02$ and $-2.07\pm0.07$, respectively. We also report the L band ($1-1.5$ GHz) spectral index of the synthetic spectrum of FRB~20220912A bursts, which is $-2.6\pm0.21$. The average rotation measure (RM) value of the bursts from FRB~20220912A is $-0.08\pm5.39\ \rm rad\,m^{-2}$, close to 0 $\rm rad\,m^{-2}$ and maintain relatively stable over two months. Most bursts have nearly 100\% linear polarization. About 45\% of the bursts have circular polarization with SNR $>$ 3, and the highest circular polarization degree can reach 70\%. Our observations suggest that FRB~20220912A is located in a relatively clean local environment with complex circular polarization characteristics. These various behaviors imply that the mechanism of circular polarization of FRBs likely originates from an intrinsic radiation mechanism, such as coherent curvature radiation or inverse Compton scattering inside the magnetosphere of the FRB engine source (e.g. a magnetar).",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.13912,X. Yang et al.,Classifying FRB spectrograms using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astronomical phenomena, and it is still uncertain whether they consist of multiple types. In this study we use two nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) - to differentiate repeaters from apparently non-repeaters in FRBs. Based on the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB catalogue, these two methods are applied to standardized parameter data and image data from a sample of 594 sub-bursts and 535 FRBs, respectively. Both methods are able to differentiate repeaters from apparently non-repeaters. The UMAP algorithm using image data produces more accurate results and is a more model-independent method. Our result shows that in general repeater clusters tend to be narrowband, which implies a difference in burst morphology between repeaters and apparently non-repeaters. We also compared our UMAP predictions with the CHIME/FRB discovery of 6 new repeaters, the performance was generally good except for one outlier. Finally, we highlight the need for a larger and more complete sample of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.11179,Davide Pelliciari et al.,The Northern Cross Fast Radio Burst project -- III. The FRB-magnetar connection in a sample of nearby galaxies,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond radio transients observed at cosmological distances. The nature of their progenitors is still a matter of debate, although magnetars are invoked by most models. The proposed FRB-magnetar connection was strengthened by the discovery of an FRB-like event from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154. In this work, we aim to investigate how prevalent magnetars such as SGR J1935+2154 are within FRB progenitors. We carried out an FRB search in a sample of seven nearby (< 12 Mpc) galaxies with the Northern Cross radio telescope for a total of 692 h. We detected one 1.8 ms burst in the direction of M101 with a fluence of $58 \pm 5$ Jy ms. Its dispersion measure of 303 pc cm$^{-3}$ places it most-likely beyond M101. Considering that no significant detection comes indisputably from the selected galaxies, we place a 38 yr$^{-1}$ upper limit on the total burst rate (i.e. including the whole sample) at the 95\% confidence level. This upper limit constrains the event rate per magnetar $\lambda_{\rm mag} < 0.42$ magnetar$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ or, if combined with literature observations of a similar sample of nearby galaxies, it yields a joint constraint of $\lambda_{\rm mag} < 0.25$ magnetar$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also provide the first constraints on the expected rate of FRBs hypothetically originating from ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources, since some of the galaxies observed during our observational campaign host confirmed ULXs. We obtain $< 13$ yr$^{-1}$ per ULX for the total sample of galaxies observed. Our results indicate that bursts with energies $E>10^{34}$ erg from magnetars like SGR J1935+2154 appear more rarely compared to previous observations and further disfavour them as unique progenitors for the cosmological FRB population, leaving more space open to the contribution from a population of more exotic magnetars, not born via core-collapsed supernovae.",astro-ph.HE

X-ray flares and fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed from the magnetar (soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR J1935+2154). We propose that the phase transition of the NS can power the FRBs and SGRs.Based on the equation of state provided by the MIT bag model and the mean field approximation, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to get the NS structure. With spin-down of the NS, the hadronic shell gradually transfers to the quark shell.The gravitational potential energy released by one time of the phase transition can be achieved. The released energy, time interval between two successive phase transitions, and glitch are all consistent with the observations of the FRBs and the X-ray flares from SGR J1935+2154. We conclude that the phase transition of an NS is a plausible mechanism to power the SGRs as well as the repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.10534,Pranav Sanghavi et al.,TONE: A CHIME/FRB Outrigger Pathfinder for localizations of Fast Radio Bursts using Very Long Baseline Interferometry,"The sensitivity and field of view of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has enabled its fast radio burst (FRB) backend to detect thousands of FRBs. However, the low angular resolution of CHIME prevents it from localizing most FRBs to their host galaxies. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) can readily provide the subarcsecond resolution needed to localize many FRBs to their hosts. Thus we developed TONE: an interferometric array of eight $6~\mathrm{m}$ dishes to serve as a pathfinder for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project, which will use wide field of view cylinders to determine the sky positions for a large sample of FRBs, revealing their positions within their host galaxies to subarcsecond precision. In the meantime, TONE's $\sim3333~\mathrm{km}$ baseline with CHIME proves to be an excellent testbed for the development and characterization of single-pulse VLBI techniques at the time of discovery. This work describes the TONE instrument, its sensitivity, and its astrometric precision in single-pulse VLBI. We believe that our astrometric errors are dominated by uncertainties in the clock measurements which build up between successive Crab pulsar calibrations which happen every $\approx 24~\mathrm{h}$; the wider fields of view and higher sensitivity of the Outriggers will provide opportunities for higher-cadence calibration. At present, CHIME-TONE localizations of the Crab pulsar yield systematic localization errors of ${0.1}-{0.2}~\mathrm{arcsec}$ - comparable to the resolution afforded by state-of-the-art optical instruments ($\sim 0.05 ~\mathrm{arcsec}$).",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2304.10377,Jay S. Chittidi et al.,Constraining the Molecular Gas Content of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Host Galaxies,"We used Bands 6 and 7 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Cycles 7 and 8 to search for $\mathrm{CO}\,(3-2)$ emission from a sample of five fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies discovered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey and the Fast and Fortunate for FRB Follow-up (F$^4$) team. These galaxies have redshifts $z \approx 0.16-0.48$, masses log$(M_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})\approx 9.30-10.4$ characteristic of field galaxies, and emission lines indicative of ongoing star formation. We detected three of the five galaxies with luminosities $L'(3-2)\approx0.2-4\times10^8\,\rm K\,km \, s^{-1}\,pc^2$ and set upper limits for the other two. Adopting standard metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors, we estimate molecular gas masses $M_{\rm gas}\approx 0.2-3\times 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$. As a population, FRB host galaxies track the main $M_{\rm star}-M_{\rm gas}$ locus of star-forming galaxies in the present-day universe, with gas fractions of $\mu_{\rm gas}\approx0.1$ and gas depletion times $t_{\rm dep} \gtrapprox 1\,$Gyr. We employ the Kaplan-Meier estimator to compare the redshift-corrected $\mu_{\rm gas}$ and $t_{\rm dep}$ for all known FRB hosts with measurements or upper limits with those from the xCOLD GASS survey and find statistically different gas fractions. The difference is not statistically significant when we consider only the five hosts studied here with consistently determined properties, suggesting more FRB hosts with measured molecular gas masses are needed to robustly study the population. Lastly, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of one host (HG20180924B) combining high-spatial resolution imaging and integral field spectroscopy to demonstrate that future high-resolution observations will allow us to study the host galaxy environments local to the FRBs.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2304.04990,Simon C. -C. Ho et al.,Future Constraints on Dark Matter with Gravitationally Lensed Fast Radio Bursts Detected by BURSTT,"Understanding dark matter is one of the most urgent questions in modern physics. A very interesting candidate is primordial black holes (PBHs; Carr2016). For the mass ranges of $< 10^{-16} M_{\odot}$ and $> 100 M_{\odot}$, PBHs have been ruled out. However, they are still poorly constrained in the mass ranges of $10^{-16} - 100 M_{\odot}$ (Belotsky et al. 2019). Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio light of unknown origin mostly from outside the Milky Way. Due to their short timescales, gravitationally lensed FRBs, which are yet to be detected, have been proposed as a useful probe for constraining the presence of PBHs in the mass window of $< 100M_{\odot}$ (Mu\~noz et al. 2016). Up to now, the most successful project in finding FRBs has been CHIME. Due to its large field of view (FoV), CHIME is detecting at least 600 FRBs since 2018. However, none of them is confirmed to be gravitationally lensed (Leung et al. 2022). Taiwan plans to build a new telescope, BURSTT dedicated to detecting FRBs. Its survey area will be 25 times greater than CHIME. BURSTT can localize all of these FRBs through very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We estimate the probability to find gravitationally lensed FRBs, based on the scaled redshift distribution from the latest CHIME catalog and the lensing probability function from Mu\~noz et al. (2016). BURSTT-2048 can detect ~ 24 lensed FRBs out of ~ 1,700 FRBs per annum. With BURSTT's ability to detect nanosecond FRBs, we can constrain PBHs to form a part of dark matter down to $10^{-4}M_{\odot}$.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.03577,"Masanori Iwamoto, Emanuele Sobacchi, Lorenzo Sironi, ",Kinetic Simulations of the Filamentation Instability in Pair Plasmas,"The nonlinear interaction between electromagnetic waves and plasmas attracts significant attention in astrophysics because it can affect the propagation of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) -- luminous millisecond-duration pulses detected at radio frequency. The filamentation instability (FI) -- a type of nonlinear wave-plasma interaction -- is considered to be dominant near FRB sources, and its nonlinear development may also affect the inferred dispersion measure of FRBs. In this paper, we carry out fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of the FI in unmagnetized pair plasmas. Our simulations show that the FI generates transverse density filaments, and that the electromagnetic wave propagates in near vacuum between them, as in a waveguide. The density filaments keep merging until force balance between the wave ponderomotive force and the plasma pressure gradient is established. We estimate the merging timescale and discuss the implications of filament merging for FRB observations.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2304.02879,Mukesh Kumar Singh et al.,DÃ©jÃ -vu et DÃ©jÃ -entendu: Associating fast radio bursts with compact binary mergers via gravitational lensing,"The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is currently an open question with several proposed sources and corresponding mechanisms for their production. Among them are compact binary coalescences (CBCs) that also generate gravitational waves (GWs). Spatial and temporal coincidences between GWs and FRBs have so far been used to search for potential FRB counterparts to GWs from CBCs. However, such methods suffer from relatively poor sky-localisation of the GW sources, and similarly poor luminosity distance estimates of both GW and FRB sources. The time delay between the GW and radio emission is also poorly understood. In this work, we propose an astrophysical scenario that could potentially provide an unambiguous association between CBCs and FRBs, if one exists, or unambiguously rule out FRB counterparts to a given CBC GW event. We demonstrate that, if a CBC that emitted both GWs and FRBs, is gravitationally lensed, we can make a $> 5\sigma$ association using time-delay estimates of the lensed GW and FRB images (in strong lensing), which are expected to be measured with mili-second (for GW) and nano-second (FRB) precisions. We also demonstrate that the CBC-FRB association can be made in the microlensing regime as well where wave-optics effects modulate the GW waveform. We further investigate the rate of such detected associations in future observing scenarios of both GW and radio detectors.",astro-ph.HE

Using the ~1 arcmin CHIME/FRB baseband localizations and probabilistic methods. We identify potential host galaxies of two FRBs, 20200223B and 20190110C at redshifts of 0.06024(2) and 0.12244(6), respectively. We also discuss the properties of a third marginal candidate host galaxy association for FRB 20191106C with a host redshift of 0.10775(1). The three putative host galaxies are all relatively massive, fall on the standard mass-metallicity relationship for nearby galaxies, and show evidence of ongoing star formation. They also all show signatures of being in a transitional regime, falling in the ""green valley"" which is between the bulk of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The plausible host galaxies identified by our analysis are consistent with the overall population of repeating and non-repeating FRB hosts while increasing the fraction of massive and bright galaxies. Coupled with these previous host associations, we identify a possible excess of FRB repeaters whose host galaxies have M_u - M_r colors redder than the bulk of star-forming galaxies. Additional precise localizations are required to confirm this trend.",astro-ph.HE

Through long-term multi-epoch studies of repeating FRBs, it is possible to assess which phenomena are common to the population and which are unique to individual sources. We present a multi-epoch monitoring campaign of the repeating FRB source 20180301A using the ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver observations with Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The observations covered a wide frequency band spanning approximately 0.7--4 GHz, and yielded the detection of 46 bursts. None of the repeat bursts displayed radio emission in the range of 1.8--4 GHz, while the burst emission peaked at 1.1 GHz. We discover evidence for secular trends in the burst dispersion measure, indicating a rate of $-2.7\pm0.2\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$. We also found significant variation in the Faraday rotation measure of the bursts across the follow-up period, including evidence of a sign reversal. While a majority of bursts did not exhibit any polarization, those that did show a decrease in the linear polarization fraction as a function of frequency, consistent with spectral depolarization due to scattering observed in other repeating FRB sources. Surprisingly, no significant variation in the polarization position angles was found, which is in contrast with earlier measurements reported for the FRB source. We measure the burst rate and sub-pulse drift rate variation and compare them with the previous results. These novel observations, along with the extreme polarization properties observed in other repeating FRBs, suggest that a sub-sample of FRB progenitors possess highly dynamic magneto-ionic environments.",astro-ph.HE

We end by discussing how diffraction effects affect optical depth forecasts and lensing near caustics, and how compact, low-frequency transients like gravitational waves and fast radio bursts provide promising paths to open up the frontier of interferometric gravitational lensing.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2303.17133,Bo Han Chen et al.,"Classifying a frequently repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20201124A, with unsupervised machine learning","Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical transients with millisecond timescales. Although most of the FRBs are not observed to repeat, a few of them are detected to repeat more than hundreds of times. There exist a large variety of physical properties among these bursts, suggesting heterogeneous mechanisms of FRBs. In this paper, we conduct a categorisation on the extremely frequently repeating FRB 20201124A with the assistance of machine learning, as such techniques have the potential to use subtle differences and correlations that humans are unaware of to better classify bursts. The research is carried out by applying the unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) model on the FRB 20201124A data provided by Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The algorithm eventually categorises the bursts into three clusters. In addition to the two categories in previous work based on waiting time, a new way for categorisation has been found. The three clusters are either high energy, high frequency, or low frequency, reflecting the distribution of FRB energy and frequency. Importantly, a similar machine learning result is found in another frequently repeating FRB20121102A, implying a common mechanism among this kind of FRB. This work is one of the first steps towards the systematical categorisation of the extremely frequently repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2303.16775,Yichao Li et al.,Fast radio burst energy function in the presence of $\rm DM_{host}$ variation,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on revealing the origin of the FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few of FRBs detected recently show large excess DM beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DM from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model to the constant $\rm DM_{host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined.",astro-ph.HE

We set out to explore the scenario where a subset of repeating FRBs originates in binary systems hosting a highly energetic neutron star and a massive companion star, akin to $\gamma$-ray binaries and young High-Mass X-ray Binaries. Firstly, we specifically focus on the host galaxy properties and binary formation rates. Subsequently, we investigate the expected evolution of the rotation and dispersion measure in this scenario, the predicted birth-site offsets, and the origin of the persistent radio emission observed in a subset of these systems. The host galaxies for repeating FRBs favour the formation of neutron star-massive star binary systems but any conclusive evidence will require future discoveries and localizations of FRBs. The birth rate of high-mass X-ray binaries, used as a proxy for all considered binaries, significantly exceeds the estimated rate of FRBs, which can be explained if only a small subset of these systems produce FRBs. We show that under simple assumptions, we can reproduce the DM and RM evolution that is seen in a subset of repeating FRBs. We also discuss the possibility of detecting a persistent radio source associated with the FRB due to an intra-binary shock between companion star wind and either the pulsar wind or giant magnetar flares. The observed long-term luminosity stability of the Persistent Radio Sources is most consistent with a giant flare-powered scenario. However, this explanation is highly dependent on the magnetic field properties of the neutron star. With these explorations, we have aimed to provide a framework to discuss future FRB observations in the context of neutron star-massive star binary scenarios.",astro-ph.HE

As a result, we obtained a non-evolving energy function (EF) for the high-energy FRBs (HEFRBs) of energies $E\gtrsim2\times0^{38}$ erg, which takes the form of a power law with a low-energy exponential cutoff. On the contrary, the energy distribution of the low-energy FRBs (LEFRBs) obviously cannot be described by the same EF. Including the lowest dispersion measure (DM) samples, the LEFRBs are concentrated towards the Galactic plane and their latitude distribution is similar to that of Galactic rotational radio transients (RRATs). These indications hint that LEFRBs might compose a special type of RRATs, with relatively higher DMs and energies (i.e., $\sim10^{28-31}$ erg for a reference distance of $\sim10$ kpc if they belong to the Milky Way). Finally, we revisit the redshift-dependent event rate of HEFRBs and confirm that they could be produced by the remnants of cosmological compact binary mergers.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2303.12598,D. Vohl et al.,A LOFAR sample of luminous compact sources coincident with nearby dwarf galaxies,"The vast majority of extragalactic, compact continuum radio sources are associated with star formation or jets from (super)massive black holes and, as such, are more likely to be found in association with starburst galaxies or early type galaxies. Recently, two new populations of radio sources have been identified: (a) compact and persistent sources (PRS) associated with fast radio bursts (FRB) in dwarf galaxies and (b) compact sources in dwarf galaxies that could belong to the long-sought population of intermediate-mass black holes. Despite the interesting aspects of these newly found sources, the current sample size is small, limiting scrutiny of the underlying population. Here, we present a search for compact radio sources coincident with dwarf galaxies. We search the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) -- the most sensitive low-frequency (144 MHz central frequency) large-area survey for optically thin synchrotron emission to date. Exploiting LoTSS' high spatial resolution (6 arcsec) and low astrometric uncertainty (about 0.2 arcsec), we match its compact sources to the compiled sample of dwarf galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe -- an H{\alpha} survey with the Palomar Observatory's 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope. We identify 29 overluminous compact radio sources, evaluate the probability of chance alignment within the sample, investigate the potential nature of these sources, and evaluate their volumetric density. While optical line-ratio diagnostics on the nebular lines from the host galaxies prefer a star-formation origin (against an AGN origin), future high angular resolution radio data is necessary to ascertain the origin of the radio sources. We discuss planned strategies to differentiate them between candidate FRB hosts and intermediate-mass black holes.",astro-ph.HE

FRB 20190520B is only the second known source sharing phenomenology akin to FRB 20121102A's, with similar burst activity, host galaxy properties, as well as being associated with a PRS. PRS emission is potentially a calorimeter, allowing us to estimate the energy output of the central FRB engine. Independently of FRB studies, PRSs have been found in dwarf galaxies and interpreted as intermediate mass black holes. To improve our understanding of such sources associated with dwarf galaxies, it is imperative to increase the known sample size.

In this work, we leverage the survey data to determine the source of the excess extragalactic dispersion measure (DM), compared to the Macquart relation estimate of four FRBs: FRB20190714A, FRB20200430A, FRB20200906A, and FRB20210117A. By modeling the gas distribution around the foreground galaxy halos and galaxy groups of the sightlines, we estimate $\rm DM_{halos}$, their contribution to the FRB dispersion measures. The FRB20190714A sightline shows a clear excess of foreground halos which contribute roughly 2/3$^{rd}$ of the observed excess DM, thus implying a baryon-dense sightline. FRB20200906A shows a smaller but non-negligible foreground halo contribution, and further analysis of the IGM is necessary to ascertain the true cosmic contribution to its DM. RB20200430A and FRB20210117A show negligible foreground contributions, implying a large host galaxy excess and/or progenitor environment excess.",astro-ph.GA

Pulsations of these highly magnetized neutron stars are also speculated to produce detectable gravitational waves. In addition, pulsations are important probes of the structure and equation of state of the neutron stars. The major challenge in studying the pulsations of highly magnetized neutron stars is the demanding numerical cost of consistently solving the nonlinear Einstein and Maxwell equations under minimum assumptions. With the recent breakthroughs in numerical solvers, we investigate pulsation modes of non-rotating neutron stars which harbour strong purely toroidal magnetic fields of $10^{15-17}$ G through two-dimensional axisymmetric general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We show that stellar oscillations are insensitive to magnetization effects until the magnetic to binding energy ratio goes beyond 10%, where the pulsation mode frequencies are strongly suppressed. We further show that this is the direct consequence of the decrease in stellar compactness when the extreme magnetic fields introduce strong deformations of the neutron stars.",astro-ph.HE

Thus, in the following decade we expect to have a very large sample of events directly related to extragalactic magnetars of different origin. This might open new possibilities to probe various aspects of NS physics.

While there have been some experiments searching for optical transients from minutes to years, none have had the capability to distinguish millisecond Fast Optical Bursts (FOB). Such very fast transients could be the optical counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB), the prompt emission from $\gamma$-Ray Bursts (GRB), or other previously unknown phenomena. Here, we investigate a novel approach to the serendipitous detection of FOBs, which relies on searching for anomalous spatial images. In particular, due to their short duration, the seeing distorted images of FOBs should look characteristically different than those of steady sources in a standard optical exposure of finite duration. We apply this idea to simulated observations with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, produced by tracing individual photons through a turbulent atmosphere, and down through the optics and camera of the Rubin telescope. We compare these simulated images to steady-source star simulations in 15 s integrations, the nominal Rubin exposure time. We report the classification accuracy results of a Neural Network classifier for distinguishing FOBs from steady sources. From this classifier, we derive constraints in duration-intensity parameter space for unambiguously identifying FOBs in Rubin observations. We conclude with estimates of the total number of detections of FOB counterparts to FRBs expected during the 10-year Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).",astro-ph.HE

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer an additional method of directly measuring the ICM and gas surrounding clusters, via observables such as dispersion measure (DM) and Faraday rotation measure (RM). We report the discovery of two FRB sources detected with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) whose host galaxies belong to massive galaxy clusters. In both cases, the FRBs exhibit excess extragalactic DM, some of which likely originates in the ICM of their respective clusters.

The discovery of FRBs in both late and early-type galaxies adds to the body of evidence that the FRB sources have multiple formation channels. Therefore, even though FRB hosts are typically star-forming, there must exist formation channels consistent with old stellar population in galaxies. The varied star formation histories of the two FRB hosts we report indicate a wide delay-time distribution of FRB progenitors.

Although a coherent search based on the likelihood ratio and Gaussian statistics has been established and utilized in many studies, this Gaussian-based method could be problematic for weak and short bursts which usually have very few counts. To deal with all bursts including weak ones, here we propose the coherent search in Poisson statistics. We studied the difference between Poisson-based and Gaussian-based search methods by Monte Carlo simulations, and find that the Poisson-based search method has advantages compared to the Gaussian case especially for weak bursts. Our results show that, for very weak bursts with very low number of counts, the Poisson-based search can provide higher significance than the Gaussian-based search, and its likelihood ratio (for background fluctuation) still generally follows the chi2 distribution, making the significance estimation of searched bursts very convenient. Thus, we suggest that the coherent search based on Poisson likelihood ratio is more appropriate in the search for generic transients including very weak ones.",astro-ph.HE

We propose a mechanism by which FRBs produced near the magnetar surface are transported out of the magnetosphere by axions, which couple to photons. If the emission site hosts strong accelerating electric fields, a considerable fraction of the FRB energy budget is converted to an axion burst. Once produced, the axion burst free-streams out of the magnetosphere due to the rapidly-decreasing magnetic field. The burst may escape through either the open or closed magnetosphere, while retaining the temporal signature of the original FRB. In the wind region, axions resonantly excite ordinary (O) modes that escape as the plasma density decreases. The radio efficiency of this mechanism satisfies energetics constraints from FRB 121102 for axion-photon coupling strengths that have not been excluded by other astrophysical probes.",astro-ph.HE

We construct a five-parameter Bayesian inference model, with the probability distributions of dispersion measures (DM) of IGM and host galaxy properly taken into account. To check the possible redshift evolution, we parameterize $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ as a mildly evolving function of redshift, $f_\mathrm{IGM}=f_\mathrm{IGM,0}[1+\alpha z/(1+z)]$. By simultaneously constraining five parameters, we get $f_\mathrm{IGM,0} = 0.92^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$ and $\alpha = 0.49^{+0.59}_{-0.47}$, and the median value of DM of host galaxy is $\exp(\mu)=72.49^{+33.31}_{-25.62}~{\rm pc ~ cm ^ {-3}}$. By fixing two parameters which can be constrained independently with other observations, we obtain $\alpha =0.11^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$ in the three-parameter fit, which is consistent with zero within $1\sigma$ uncertainty.

For FRB 20210408H, we tentatively (0.35 - 0.53 probability) identify a compatible host at a redshift ~0.5. Additionally, we analyse the MeerTRAP survey properties, such as the survey coverage, fluence completeness, and their implications for the FRB population. Based on the entire sample of 11 MeerTRAP FRBs discovered by the end of 2021, we estimate the FRB all-sky rates and their scaling with the fluence threshold.

The scaling between the MeerTRAP rates is flatter than at higher fluences at the 1.4-$\sigma$ level.

arXiv:2302.10072,"Robert Reischke, Steffen Hagstotz, ",Consistent Constraints on the Equivalence Principle from localised Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short astrophysical transients of extragalactic origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the large-scale-structure (LSS), leading to delayed arrival times at different frequencies. Another potential source of time delay is the well known Shapiro delay, which measures the space-space and time-time metric perturbations along the line-of-sight. If photons of different frequencies follow different trajectories, i.e. if the universality of free fall guaranteed by the weak equivalence principle (WEP) is violated, they would experience an additional relative delay. This quantity, however, is not an observable on the background level as it is not gauge independent, which has led to confusion in previous papers. Instead, an imprint can be seen in the correlation between the time delays of different pulses. In this paper, we derive robust and consistent constraints from twelve localised FRBs on the violation of the WEP in the energy range between 4.6 and 6 meV. In contrast to a number of previous studies, we consider our signal to be not in the model, but in the covariance matrix of the likelihood. To do so, we calculate the covariance of the time delays induced by the free electrons in the LSS, the WEP breaking terms, the Milky Way and host galaxy. By marginalising over both host galaxy contribution and the contribution from the free electrons, we find that the parametrised post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ characterising the WEP violation must be constant in this energy range to 1 in $10^{13}$ at 68$\;\%$ confidence. These are the tightest constraints to-date on $\Delta\gamma$ in this low energy range.",astro-ph.CO

Bezuidenhout et al.,Tied-Array Beam Localisation of Radio Transients and Pulsars,"Multi-element interferometers such as MeerKAT, which observe with high time resolution and have a wide field-of-view, provide an ideal opportunity to perform real-time, untargeted transient and pulsar searches. However, because of data storage limitations, it is not always feasible to store the baseband data required to image the field of a discovered transient or pulsar. This limits the ability of surveys to effectively localise their discoveries and may restrict opportunities for follow-up science, especially of one-off events like some Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Here we present a novel maximum-likelihood estimation approach to localising transients and pulsars detected in multiple MeerKAT tied-array beams at once, which we call Tied Array Beam Localisation (TABLo), as well as a Python implementation of the method named SeeKAT. We provide real-world examples of SeeKAT's use as well as a Monte Carlo analysis to show that it is capable of localising single pulses detected in beamformed MeerKAT data to (sub-)arcsecond precision.",astro-ph.HE

It was detected while MeerTRAP was observing commensally with the ThunderKAT large survey project, and was sufficiently bright that we could use the ThunderKAT 8s images to localise the FRB. Two different models of the dispersion measure in the Milky Way and halo suggest that the source is either right at the edge of the Galaxy, or outside. However, we use the combined localisation, dispersion measure, scattering, specific luminosity and chance coincidence probability information to find that the origin is most likely extragalactic and identify the likely host galaxy of the FRB: 2MASS J1701249$-$4932475. Using SALT spectroscopy and archival observations of the field, we find that the host is a disk/spiral galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.066$.",astro-ph.HE

FRB 20210410D has a dispersion measure DM = 578.78 +/- 2 pc cm-3, and was localised to sub-arcsec precision in the 2s images made from the correlation data products. The localisation enabled the association of the FRB with an optical galaxy at z = 0.1415, which when combined with the DM places it above the 3sigma scatter of the Macquart relation. We attribute the excess DM to the host galaxy after accounting for contributions from the Milky Way's interstellar medium and halo, and the combined effects of the intergalactic medium and intervening galaxies. This is the first FRB that is not associated with a dwarf galaxy, to exhibit a likely large host galaxy DM contribution. We do not detect any continuum radio emission at the FRB position or from the host galaxy down to a 3sigma RMS of 14.4 uJy/beam. The FRB has a scattering delay of 29.4 ms at 1 GHz, and exhibits candidate subpulses in the spectrum, which hint at the possibility of it being a repeating FRB. Although not constraining, we note that this FRB has not been seen to repeat in 7.28h at 1.3 GHz with MeerKAT, 3h at 2.4 GHz with Murriyang and 5.7h at simultaneous 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz observations with the Deep Space Network.

arXiv:2302.09697,"Yuanhong Qu, Bing Zhang, ",Polarization of Fast Radio Bursts: radiation mechanisms and propagation effects,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are observed to be highly polarized. Most have high linear polarization but a small fraction show significant circular polarization. We systematically investigate a variety of polarization mechanisms of FRBs within the magnetar theoretical framework considering two emission sites inside and outside the magnetosphere. For each site, we discuss both intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Inside the magnetosphere, we investigate the polarization properties of both coherent curvature radiation and inverse Compton scattering by charged bunches and conclude that both mechanisms produce 100\% linear polarization at an on-axis geometry but can produce circular polarization if the viewing angle is off axis. The lack of circular polarization for the majority of bursts requires that the bunches have a large transverse dimension size. Resonant cyclotron absorption within magnetosphere may produce high circular polarization if electrons and positrons have an asymmetric Lorentz factor distribution. Outside the magnetosphere, the synchrotron maser emission mechanism in general produces highly linearly polarized emission. Circular polarization would appear at off-beam angles but the flux is greatly degraded and such bursts are not detectable at cosmological distances. Synchrotron absorption in a nebula with ordered magnetic field may reduce the circular polarization degree. Cyclotron absorption in a strongly magnetized medium may generate significant circular polarization. Faraday conversion in a medium with field reversal can convert one polarization mode to another. The two absorption processes require stringent physical conditions. Significant Faraday conversion may be realized in a magnetized dense environment involving binary systems or supernova remnants.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2302.08848,"Praveen Sharma, Maxim Barkov, Maxim Lyutikov, ",Relativistic coronal mass ejections from magnetars,"We study dynamics of relativistic Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), from launching by shearing of foot-points (either slowly - the ``Solar flare'' paradigm, or suddenly - the ``star quake"" paradigm), to propagation in the preceding magnetar wind. For slow shear, most of the energy injected into the CME is first spent on the work done on breaking through the over-laying magnetic field. At later stages, sufficiently powerful CMEs may experience ``detonation"" and lead to opening of the magnetosphere beyond some equipartition radius $r_{eq}$, where the energy of the CME becomes larger than the decreasing external magnetospheric energy. Post-CME magnetosphere relaxes via formation of a plasmoid-mediated current sheet, initially at $\sim r_{eq}$ and slowly reaching the light cylinder (this transient stage has much higher spindown rate and may produce an ``anti-glitch''). Both the location of the foot-point shear and the global magnetospheric configuration affect the frequent-and-weak versus rare-and-powerful CME dichotomy - to produce powerful flares the slow shear should be limited to field lines that close near the star. After the creation of a topologically disconnected flux tube, the tube quickly (at $\sim$ the light cylinder) comes into force-balance with the preceding wind, and is passively advected/frozen in the wind afterward. For fast shear (a local rotational glitch), the resulting large amplitude Alfven waves lead to opening of the magnetosphere (which later recovers similarly to the slow shear case). At distances much larger than the light cylinder, the resulting shear Alfven waves propagate through the wind non-dissipatively. Implications to Fast Radio Bursts are discussed.",astro-ph.HE

Repeating FRBs offer insight into the FRB population by enabling spectral, temporal and polarimetric properties to be tracked over time. Here, we report on the polarized observations of 12 repeating sources using multi-year monitoring with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) over 400-800 MHz. We observe significant RM variations from many sources in our sample, including RM changes of several hundred $\rm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ over month timescales from FRBs 20181119A, 20190303A and 20190417A, and more modest RM variability ($\rm{\Delta RM \lesssim}$ few tens rad m$^{-2}$) from FRBs 20181030A, 20190208A, 20190213B and 20190117A over equivalent timescales. Several repeaters display a frequency dependent degree of linear polarization that is consistent with depolarization via scattering. Combining our measurements of RM variations with equivalent constraints on DM variability, we estimate the average line-of-sight magnetic field strength in the local environment of each repeater. In general, repeating FRBs display RM variations that are more prevalent/extreme than those seen from radio pulsars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting repeating FRBs and pulsars occupy distinct magneto-ionic environments.",astro-ph.HE

Mahlmann et al.,Three-dimensional dynamics of strongly twisted magnetar magnetospheres: Kinking flux tubes and global eruptions,"The origins of the various outbursts of hard X-rays from magnetars (highly magnetized neutron stars) are still unknown. We identify instabilities in relativistic magnetospheres that can explain a range of X-ray flare luminosities. Crustal surface motions can twist the magnetar magnetosphere by shifting the frozen-in footpoints of magnetic field lines in current-carrying flux bundles. Axisymmetric (2D) magnetospheres exhibit strong eruptive dynamics, as to say, catastrophic lateral instabilities triggered by a critical footpoint displacement of $\psi_{\rm crit}\gtrsim\pi$. In contrast, our new three-dimensional (3D) twist models with finite surface extension capture important non-axisymmetric dynamics of twisted force-free flux bundles in dipolar magnetospheres. Besides the well-established global eruption resulting (as in 2D) from lateral instabilities, such 3D structures can develop helical, kink-like dynamics, and dissipate energy locally (confined eruptions). Up to $25\%$ of the induced twist energy is dissipated and available to power X-ray flares in powerful global eruptions, with most of our models showing an energy release in the range of the most common X-ray outbursts, $\lesssim 10^{43}$erg. Such events occur when significant energy builds up deeply buried in the dipole magnetosphere. Less energetic outbursts likely precede powerful flares, due to intermittent instabilities and confined eruptions of a continuously twisting flux tube. Upon reaching a critical state, global eruptions produce the necessary Poynting-flux-dominated outflows required by models prescribing the fast radio burst production in the magnetar wind -- for example, via relativistic magnetic reconnection or shocks.",astro-ph.HE

The memory is detected from the coherent growths in burst-rate structures and the Hurst exponent. The waiting time distribution displays a power-law tail, which is consistent with a Poisson model with a time-varying rate. From cellular automaton simulations, we find that these characteristics can be well understood within the physical framework of a self-organized criticality system driven in a correlation way, such as random walk functions. These properties indicate that the triggers of bursts are correlated, preferring the crustal failure mechanism of neutron stars.",astro-ph.HE

Furthermore, the exact DM is itself of interest when studying the time-evolution of the medium through which multiple bursts from repeating FRBs propagate. A commonly used approach to obtain the dispersion measure is to take the value that maximizes the FRB structure in the time domain. However, various authors use differing methods to obtain this structure parameter, and do not document the smoothing method used. Furthermore, there are no quantitative estimates of the error in this procedure in the FRB literature. In this letter, we present a smoothing filter based on the discrete cosine transform, and show that computing the structure parameter by summing the squares of the derivatives and taking the square root immediately lends itself to calculation of uncertainty of the structure parameter. We illustrate this with FRB181112 and FRB210117 data, which were detected by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, and for which high-time-resolution data is available.",astro-ph.HE

Gordon et al.,"The Demographics, Stellar Populations, and Star Formation Histories of Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies: Implications for the Progenitors","We present a comprehensive catalog of observations and stellar population properties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our sample comprises six repeating FRBs and 17 apparent non-repeaters. We present 82 new photometric and eight new spectroscopic observations of these hosts. Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar mass of $\approx 10^{9.9}\,M_{\odot}$, mass-weighted age $\approx 5.1$ Gyr, and ongoing star formation rate $\approx 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ but span wide ranges in all properties. Classifying the hosts by degree of star formation, we find that 87% (20/23 hosts) are star-forming, two are transitioning, and one is quiescent. The majority trace the star-forming main sequence of galaxies, but at least three FRBs in our sample originate in less active environments (two non-repeaters and one repeater). Across all modeled properties, we find no statistically significant distinction between the hosts of repeaters and non-repeaters. However, the hosts of repeating FRBs generally extend to lower stellar masses, and the hosts of non-repeaters arise in more optically luminous galaxies. While four of the galaxies with the most clear and prolonged rises in their SFHs all host repeating FRBs, demonstrating heightened star formation activity in the last $\lesssim 100$ Myr, one non-repeating host shows this SFH as well. Our results support progenitor models with short delay channels (i.e., magnetars formed via core-collapse supernova) for most FRBs, but the presence of some FRBs in less active environments suggests a fraction form through more delayed channels.",astro-ph.GA

Precise measurements of the timing and spectral properties of the X-ray bursts are helpful for understanding the physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this paper, we have reconstructed some information about the hard X-ray events, which were lost because the High Energy X-ray Telescope (HE) onboard the Insight-HXMT mission was saturated by this extremely bright burst, and used the information to improve the temporal and spectral analyses of the X-ray burst. The arrival times of the two X-ray peaks by fitting the new Insight-HXMT/HE lightcurve with multi-Gaussian profiles are 2.77+-0.45 ms and 34.30+-0.56 ms after the first peak of FRB 200428, respectively, while these two parameters are 2.57+-0.52 ms and 32.5+-1.4 ms if the fitting profile is a fast rise and exponential decay function.

Important issues for this radiation mechanism include how the bunches form and disperse in the magnetosphere of a pulsar or magnetar. More likely, bunches form and disperse continuously and it remains unclear what the spectral features are for these fluctuating bunches. In this work, we consider that the bunches in a magnetosphere have a formation rate of $\lambda_B$, a lifetime of $\tau_B$, and a typical Lorentz factor of $\gamma$, and analyze the spectral features of coherent curvature radiation by these fluctuating bunches. We find that the emission spectrum by a single fluctuating bunch is suppressed by a factor of $\sim(\lambda_B\tau_B)^2$ compared with that of a single persistent bunch, and there is a quasi-white noise in a wider band in the frequency domain. The high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum is at $\sim\max(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$, where $\omega_{\rm peak}$ is the peak frequency of curvature radiation. If the observed spectrum is not white-noise-like, the condition of $2\gamma^2\lambda_B\gtrsim \min(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$ would be required. Besides, the radiation by multiple fluctuating bunches along a field line is the incoherent summation of the radiation by single bunches if the bunch separation is longer than the wavelength. Conversely, a coherent summation should be involved. We also discuss the effects of bunch structures and the mechanism of bunch formation and dispersion.",astro-ph.HE

Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the literature, the dispersion measure DM of FRB has been considered extensively. It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB. The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$ directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models.

To date, none of these has a known gamma-ray counterpart. Taking advantage of more than 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we perform a search for gamma-ray emission from almost all the reported repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We analyze on different time scales the Fermi-LAT data for each individual source separately and perform a cumulative analysis on the repeating ones. In addition, we perform the first stacking analysis at GeV energies of this class of sources in order to constrain the gamma-ray properties of the FRBs. The stacking analysis is a powerful method that allows for a possible detection from below-threshold FRBs providing important information on these objects.

arXiv:2301.04602,"Shuang Du, ",On the effect of the variation of velocity fields in pulsars,"Glitches are sudden spin-up events of pulsars and are usually thought to be induced by unpinning of neutron superfluid vortices in pulsar crusts. Unpinning and repinning of superfluid vortices, and even thermoelectric effects induced by the deposited heat released during glitches, may vary the velocity fields in pulsars. We show that the generally invoked magnetic dipole fields of pulsars cannot remain stationary during the variation of the velocity fields, so that multipole components must be generated. We argue that the increase of the spark frequency of periodic radio pulses is the indicator for the emergence of the multipole components. Interpretations of pulsar nulling, rebrightening of radio-quiet magnetars, differences between Crab and Vela pulsars after glitches, and extra-galactic fast radio burst-like events from SGR 1935+2154 have been proposed based on the influence of the variation of the velocity field on the magnetic field.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, we explore the covariance matrix of the dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs induced by the large-scale structure, as bursts from a similar direction on the sky are correlated by long wavelength modes of the electron distribution. We derive analytical expressions for the covariance matrix and examine the impact on parameter estimation from the FRB dispersion measure - redshift relation. The covariance also contains additional information that is missed by analysing the events individually. For future samples containing over $\sim300$ FRBs with host identification over the full sky, the covariance needs to be taken into account for unbiased inference, and the effect increases dramatically for smaller patches of the sky. Also forecasts must consider these effects as they would yield too optimistic parameter constraints. Our procedure can also be applied to the DM of the afterglow of Gamma Ray Bursts.",astro-ph.CO

This constraint implies upper limits on the MW halo DM contribution that range over 52-111 pc cm^-3. We discuss the viability of various gas density profiles for the MW halo that have been used to estimate the halo's contribution to DMs of extragalactic sources. Several models overestimate the DM contribution, especially when assuming higher halo gas masses (~ 3.5 x 10^12 solar masses). Some halo models predict a higher MW halo DM contribution than can be supported by our observations unless the effect of feedback is increased within them, highlighting the impact of feedback processes in galaxy formation.",astro-ph.GA

We derive a conservative upper limit on the DM contributed by the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way: the limit is either 28.7 pc cm$^{-3}$ and 47.3 pc cm$^{-3}$, depending on which of two pulsars nearby on the sky to FRB 20220319D is used to estimate the ISM DM. These limits both imply that the total Galactic CGM mass is $<10^{11}M_{\odot}$, and that the baryonic mass of the Milky Way is $\lesssim60\%$ of the cosmological average given the total halo mass. More stringent albeit less conservative constraints are possible when the DMs of pulsars in the distant globular cluster M53 are additionally considered. Although our constraints are sensitive to possible anisotropy in the CGM and to the assumed form of the radial-density profile, they are not subject to uncertainties in the chemical and thermal properties of the CGM. Our results strongly support scenarios commonly predicted by galaxy-formation simulations wherein feedback processes expel baryonic matter from the halos of galaxies like the Milky Way.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2212.13433,Ze-Wei Zhao et al.,First statistical measurement of the Hubble constant using unlocalized fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the Hubble constant by employing the Macquart relation. However, at present, only a small number of FRB events are localized to their host galaxies with known redshifts. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian method to statistically measure the Hubble constant using unlocalized FRBs and galaxy catalog data, which makes it possible to constrain cosmological parameters by using a large number of FRB data without known redshift information. Using the six FRB events observed by ASKAP combined with the big bang nucleosynthesis result, we obtain $H_0=71.7^{+8.8}_{-7.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the simulation-based case and $H_0=71.5^{+10.0}_{-8.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the observation-based case ($68\%$ highest-density interval), assuming different host galaxy population parameters. We also estimate that in the next few years, using thousands of FRBs could achieve a $3\%$ precision on the random error of the Hubble constant.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2212.13153,Ze-Nan Liu et al.,The Statistical Polarization Properties of Coherent Curvature Radiation by Bunches: Application to Fast Radio Burst Repeaters,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients with millisecond duration and extremely high brightness temperature. Very recently, some highly circularly polarized bursts were found in a repeater, FRB 20201124A. The significant circular polarization might be produced by coherent curvature radiation by bunches with the line of sight (LOS) deviating from the bunch central trajectories. In this work, we carry out simulations to study the statistical properties of burst polarization within the framework of coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches in the neutron star magnetosphere for repeating FRBs. The flux is almost constant within the opening angle of the bunch. However, when the LOS derivates from the bunch opening angle, the larger the derivation, the larger the circular polarization but the lower the flux. We investigate the statistical distribution of circular polarization and flux of radio bursts from an FRB repeater, and find that most of the bursts with high circular polarization have a relatively low flux. Besides, we find that most of the depolarization degrees of bursts have a small variation in a wide frequency band. Furthermore, we simulate the polarization angle (PA) evolution and find that most bursts show a flat PA evolution within the burst phases, and some bursts present a swing of PA.",astro-ph.HE

With the help of the latest set of FRBs in this large-size catalog, we aim to investigate the dispersion measure (DM) or redshift ($z$) distribution of the FRB population, and solution of this problem could be used to clarify the question of FRB origin. In this study, we adopted the M\&E 2018 model, to fit the observed $z$ distribution of FRBs in Catalog 1. In the M\&E 2018 model, we are mostly interested in the $\Phi(z)$ function, i.e., number of bursts per proper time per comoving volume, which is represented by the star formation rate (SFR) with a power-law index $n$. Our estimated value of $n$ is $0.0_{-0.0}^{+0.6}$ ($0.0_{-0.0}^{+2.1}$) at the 68 (95) per cent confidence level, implying that the FRB population evolves with redshift consistent with, or faster than, the SFR. Specially, the consistency of the $n$ values estimated by this study and the SFR provides a potential support for the hypothesis of FRBs originating from young magnetars.",astro-ph.HE

These so-called 'baseband localizations' improve the localization uncertainty area presented in past studies by more than three orders of magnitude. The improved localization regions are provided for the full sample of FRBs to enable follow-up studies. The localization uncertainties, together with limits on the source distances from their dispersion measures (DMs), allow us to identify likely host galaxies for two of the FRB sources. FRB 20180814A lives in a massive passive red spiral at z~0.068 with very little indication of star formation, while FRB 20190303A resides in a merging pair of spiral galaxies at z~0.064 undergoing significant star formation.

Metzger, Ke Fang, ",High-Energy Neutrinos from Gamma-Ray-Faint Accretion-Powered Hypernebulae,"Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock$-$where the collimated fast disk winds/jet collide with the slower, wide-angled winds$-$can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic ($pp$) reactions, and photohadronic ($p\gamma$) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the ms-duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources$-$if associated with hypernebulae$-$could contribute to the high energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of steller-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission$-$depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates$-$could explain $\gtrsim 25\%$ of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal-GVD Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula$-$depending on the population parameters$-$can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to $>$100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit-Wheeler ($\gamma\gamma$) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV-PeV gamma-rays co-produced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.",astro-ph.HE

FRBs are a rapidly growing class of Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical objects that are considered a potential source of high-energy neutrinos. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory's previous FRB analyses have solely used track events. This search utilizes seven years of IceCube's cascade events which are statistically independent of the track events. This event selection allows probing of a longer range of extended timescales due to the low background rate. No statistically significant clustering of neutrinos was observed. Upper limits are set on the time-integrated neutrino flux emitted by FRBs for a range of extended time-windows.",astro-ph.HE

Only a small fraction of FRBs apparently repeat. Polarization, a fundamental property of electromagnetic signals, often carries critical information about the radiation processes, the environment, and the intervening medium of FRBs. Here we report circular polarization detections of two active repeating FRBs, namely FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B, with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We detect circular polarization in both active repeating FRBs, which increases the number of repeating FRBs with circular polarization to three. In one of the bursts of FRB 20121102A, we detect 64% degree of circular polarization. The observed circular polarization is unlikely induced by multipath propagation. Our observations favor circular polarization induced by Faraday conversion or radiation mechanism intrinsic to the FRB source. The conditions to generate circular polarization have to be rare in either case.",astro-ph.HE

Although a firm connection between at least some FRBs and magnetars has been established, the trigger mechanism and radiation process in these enigma phenomena are still highly controversial. In this study, we build a sample of 16 repeating FRBs from which at least five bursts have been detected, including the most active four repeaters of FRBs 20121102A, 20180916B, 20190520B and 20201124A. Various key parameters of their bursts are collected from the literature, which include the arrival time, pulse width, dispersion measure (DM), Faraday rotation measure (RM), bandwidth, waiting time, peak flux and fluence. The distribution and time evolution of these parameters are investigated. Potential correlations between various parameter pairs are also extensively explored. The behaviors of different repeaters are then compared. It is found that the DM of FRB 20121102A seems to increase continuously on a long timescale. While the DM of most repeaters varies in a narrow range of $\pm 3$ cm$^{-3}$ pc, FRB 20190520B is found to have a large variation range of $\pm 12$ cm$^{-3}$ pc. RM evolves with time in a much more chaos behavior in different repeaters. A linear correlation is found between the absolute mean RM and $\rm {DM}_{Host}$, which may provide a method to estimate the redshift of FRBs. Generally, the waiting time shows a similar bimodal distribution for the active repeating sources. The implications of these features to the underlying physics are discussed.",astro-ph.HE

And the distribution functions of fluctuations of energy well follow the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian distribution. The $q$ values in the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian distribution are constant with small fluctuations for different temporal scale intervals, indicating a scale-invariant structure of the bursts.

Main et al.,Modelling Annual Scintillation Velocity Variations of FRB 20201124A,"Compact radio sources exhibit scintillation, an interference pattern arising from propagation through inhomogeneous plasma, where scintillation patterns encode the relative distances and velocities of the source, scattering material, and Earth. In previous work, we showed that the scintillation velocity of the repeating fast radio burst FRB20201124A could be measured by correlating burst spectra pairs, with low values of the scintillation velocity and scattering timescale suggesting scattering nearby the Earth at $\sim0.4\,$kpc. In this work, we have measured the scintillation velocity at 10 epochs spanning a year, observing an annual variation which strongly implies the screen is within the Milky Way. Modelling the annual variation with a 1D anisotropic or 2D isotropic screen results in a screen distance $d_{l} = 0.40\pm0.04\,$kpc or $d_{l} = 0.46\pm0.06\,$kpc from Earth respectively, possibly associated with material outside of the Local Bubble or the edge of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble. Additional measurements particularly at times of low effective velocity will help probe changes in screen properties, and distinguish between screen models. Where scintillation of an FRB originates in its host galaxy or local environment, these techniques could be used to detect orbital motion, and probe the FRB's local ionised environment.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2212.04027,Tzu-Yin Hsu et al.,The molecular gas kinematics in the host galaxy of non-repeating FRB 180924B,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients with large dispersion measures. The origin of FRBs is still mysterious. One of the methods to comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host galaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical because it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of FRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused on its stellar component. Therefore, we, for the first time, report the molecular gas kinematics in the host galaxy of the non-repeating FRB 180924B at $z= 0.3216$. Two velocity components of the CO (3-2) emission line are detected in its host galaxy with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA): the peak of one component ($-155.40$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the centre of the host galaxy, and another ($-7.76$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the FRB position. The CO (3-2) spectrum shows asymmetric profiles with A$_{\rm peak}$ $=2.03\pm 0.39$, where A$_{\rm peak}$ is the peak flux density ratio between the two velocity components. The CO (3-2) velocity map also indicates an asymmetric velocity gradient from $-180$ km s$^{-1}$ to 8 km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a disturbed kinetic structure of molecular gas in the host galaxy. Such disturbed kinetic structures are reported for repeating FRB host galaxies using HI emission lines in previous works. Our finding indicates that non-repeating and repeating FRBs could commonly appear in disturbed kinetic environments, suggesting a possible link between the gas kinematics and FRB progenitors.",astro-ph.GA

The rapid accumulation of the observational data has painted the following sketch about the physical origin of FRBs: They predominantly originate from cosmological distances so that their sources produce the most extreme coherent radio emission in the universe; at least some, probably most, FRBs are repeating sources that do not invoke cataclysmic events; and at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the universe. Many open questions regarding the physical origin(s) and mechanism(s) of FRBs remain. This article reviews the phenomenology and possible underlying physics of FRBs. Topics include: a summary of the observational data, basic plasma physics, general constraints on FRB models from the data, radiation mechanisms, source and environment models, propagation effects, as well as FRBs as cosmological probes.

In this work we study the most probable host galaxy of the apparently non-repeating CHIME/FRB event FRB 20190425A -- a particularly high luminosity, low dispersion measure event that was demonstrated by Moroianu et al. 2022 to be temporally and spatially coincident with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary neutron star merger GW190425, suggesting an astrophysical association (p-value 0.0052). In this paper we remain agnostic to this result, and we confirm UGC10667 as the most probable host galaxy of FRB 20190425A, demonstrating that the host galaxies of low dispersion measure, one-off CHIME FRBs can be plausibly identified. We then perform multi-wavelength observations to characterize the galaxy and search for any afterglow emission associated with the FRB and its putative GW counterpart. We find no radio or optical transient emission in our observations $2.5\,\mathrm{yr}$ post-burst. UGC10667 is a spiral galaxy at $z\sim0.03$, dominated by an old stellar population. We find no evidence of a large population of young stars, with nebular emission dominated by star formation at a rate of $1-2\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$.

arXiv:2212.00201,Alexandra Moroianu et al.,An assessment of the Association Between a Fast Radio Burst and Binary Neutron Star Merger,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious bright millisecond-duration radio bursts at cosmological distances. While young magnetars have been put forward as the leading source candidate, recent observations suggest there may be multiple FRB progenitor classes. It has long been theorised that FRBs could be emitted from compact object mergers - cataclysmic events such as binary neutron star (BNS) mergers that may be detectable in gravitational waves (GWs) by the ground-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)and Virgo. Here we report a potential coincidence between the only BNS merger event GW190425 out of 21 GW sources detected during the first six months of LIGO-Virgo's 3rd Science Run and a bright, non-repeating FRB event, FRB 20190425A, from a search using public GW and CHIME FRB data. The FRB is located within the GW's sky localization area, occurred 2.5 hours after the GW event, and has a dispersion measure consistent with the distance inferred from GW parameter estimation. The chance probability of a coincidence between unrelated FRB and GW events in the databases is estimated to be 0.0052 ($2.8 \sigma$). We estimate the chance of CHIME detecting such an event to range from 0.4% for a beam-centre detection to 68% if a bright burst is detectable in a far sidelobe. This potential association is consistent with the theory that the BNS merger leaves behind a supramassive, highly magnetized compact object, which collapses to form a black hole after losing angular momentum due to spindown and makes an FRB through ejecting the magnetosphere. If such a physical association is established, the equation of state of the post-merger compact object is likely stiff, with a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff non-spinning maximum mass $M_{TOV} > 2.63_{-0.23}^{+0.39} M_\odot$ for a neutron star remnant, or $M_{TOV} > 2.31_{-0.08}^{+0.24} M_\odot$ for a quark star remnant.",astro-ph.HE

The sub-arcsecond localization of the burst led to the identification of its host galaxy at a $z=0.214(1)$. This redshift is much lower than what would be expected for a source dispersion measure (DM) of 729 pc cm$^{-3}$, given typical contributions from the intergalactic medium and the host galaxy. Optical observations reveal the host to be a dwarf galaxy with little on-going star formation, very different to the dwarf host galaxies of known repeating FRBs 20121102A, and 20190520B. We find an excess DM contribution from the host and attribute it to the FRB's local environment. We do not find any radio emission from the FRB site or host galaxy. The low magnetized environment and lack of a persistent radio source (PRS) indicate that the FRB source is older than those found in other dwarf host galaxies, and establish the diversity of FRB sources in dwarf galaxy environments. We find our observations to be fully consistent with the hypernebula model, where the FRB is powered by accretion-jet from a hyper-accreting black hole. Finally, our high-time resolution analysis reveals burst characteristics similar to those seen in repeating FRBs.

These constitute the first detections of a fast radio burst (FRB) or a radio transient using 2-s timescale images with MeerKAT data. Analysis of the fitted burst properties revealed a weighted average precision of 1 arcsec in the localization of the bursts. The accurate knowledge of FRB positions is essential for identifying their host galaxy and understanding their mysterious nature which is still unresolved to this day. We also produced 2-s images at 1.09 GHz but yielded no detection which we attributed to the spectral structure of the pulses that are mostly higher in strength in the upper frequencies. We also explore a new approach to difference imaging analysis (DIA) to search for transients and find that our technique has the potential to reduce the number of candidates and could be used to automate the detection of FRBs in the image plane for future MeerKAT observations.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2211.12026,Nurimangul Nurmamat et al.,Repeating fast radio bursts produced by a strange star interacting with its planet in an eccentric orbit,"FRB 180916 is an important repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source. Interestingly, the activity of FRB 180916 shows a well-regulated behavior, with a period of 16.35 days. The bursts are found to occur in a duty circle of about 5 days in each period. In this study, we suggest that the bursts of FRB 180916 are produced by a strange star interacting with its planet. The planet moves in a highly eccentric orbit around its compact host, with the periastron only slightly beyond the tidal disruption radius. As a result, the planet will be partially disrupted every time it passes through the periastron. The stripped material from the planet will be accreted by the strange star, falling to the polar cap region along the magnetic field lines and accumulated there. It will finally lead to a local collapse when the crust at the polar region is overloaded, triggering an FRB. The observed 16.35 day period corresponds to the orbital motion of the planet, and the 5 day duty circle is explained as the duration of the partial disruption near the periastron. The energy released in each local collapse event can be as high as $\sim 10^{42}~\rm {erg}$, which is large enough to account for typical FRBs even if the radiation efficiency is extremely low.",astro-ph.HE

This is the first time that the MWA VCS has been used to search for FRB signals from known repeaters, which enables much more sensitive FRB searches than previously performed with the standard MWA correlator mode. We performed a standard single pulse search with a temporal and spectral resolution of $400\,\mu$s and 10\,kHz, respectively, over a $100\,\text{pc}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ dispersion measure (DM) range centred at the known DM of each studied repeating FRB. No FRBs exceeding a $6\sigma$ threshold were detected. The fluence upper limits in the range of 32--1175\,Jy\,ms and 36--488\,Jy\,ms derived from 10 observations of FRB 20190711A and four observations of FRB 20201124A respectively, allow us to constrain the spectral indices of their bursts to $\gtrsim-1$ if these two repeaters were active during the MWA observations. If free-free absorption is responsible for our non-detection, we can constrain the size of the absorbing medium in terms of the electron temperature $T$ to $<1.00\times(T/10^4\text{K})^{-1.35}\,\text{pc}$, $<0.92\times(T/10^4\text{K})^{-1.35}\,\text{pc}$ and $<[0.22\text{--}2.50]\times(T/10^4\text{K})^{-1.35}\,\text{pc}$ for FRB 20190117A, 20190711A, and 20201124A, respectively.

The two bursts have disparate polarization properties and temporal profiles. We find a Faraday rotation measure that is consistent with the low value of $+0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ reported by CHIME/FRB. The DSA-110 localization overlaps with the galaxy PSO J347.2702+48.7066 at a redshift $z=0.0771$, which we identify as the likely host. PSO J347.2702$+$48.7066 has a stellar mass of approximately $10^{10}M_{\odot}$, modest internal dust extinction, and a star-formation rate likely in excess of $0.1\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

The high accuracy of burst periodicity (better than one part in 10$^3$), and the 2\% duty cycle (ratio of burst-duration and inter-burst interval), suggest a pulsar-like rotating beam model for the observed activity; the radio waves are produced along open field lines within $\sim 10^7$ cm of the neutron star surface, and the beam periodically sweeps across the observer as the star spins. According to this picture, FRB 20191221A is a factor $\sim 10^{12}$ scaled up version of galactic pulsars with one major difference: whereas pulsars convert rotational kinetic energy to EM waves, the outbursts of 20191221A require conversion of magnetic energy to radiation.",astro-ph.HE

Dobie et al.,"Radio Transients and Variables in the Tenth Deeper, Wider, Faster Observing Run","The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program coordinates observations with telescopes across the electromagnetic spectrum, searching for transients on timescales of milliseconds to days. The tenth DWF observing run was carried out in near real-time during September 2021 and consisted of six consecutive days of observations of the NGC 6744 galaxy group and a field containing the repeating fast radio burst FRB190711 with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Dark Energy Camera, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope and the Parkes 64m ""Murriyang"" radio telescope. In this work we present the results of an image-domain search for transient, variable and circularly polarised sources carried out with ASKAP using data from the observing run, along with test observations prior to the run and follow-up observations carried out during and after the run. We identified eight variable radio sources, consisting of one pulsar, six stellar systems (five of which exhibit circularly polarised emission) and one previously uncatalogued source. Of particular interest is the detection of pulses from the ultra-cool dwarf SCR J1845-6357 with a period of $14.2\pm 0.3$ h, in good agreement with the known optical rotation period, making this the slowest rotating radio-loud ultra-cool dwarf discovered.",astro-ph.HE

In this review I describe the discovery of FRBs, subsequent advances in our understanding of them, and future prospects. Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day; they probably originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this sub-class often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeaters exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was from a Galactic magnetar during an X-ray outburst.

arXiv:2211.05209,Rebecca Lin et al.,Resolving the Emission Regions of the Crab Pulsar's Giant Pulses II. Evidence for Relativistic Motion,"The Crab Pulsar is the prime example of an emitter of giant pulses. These short, very bright pulses are thought to originate near the light cylinder, at $\sim\!1600{\rm\;km}$ from the pulsar. The pulsar's location inside the Crab Nebula offers an unusual opportunity to resolve the emission regions, using the nebula, which scatters radio waves, as a lens. We attempt to do this using a sample of 61998 giant pulses found in coherently combined European VLBI network observations at $18{\rm\;cm}$. These were taken at times of relatively strong scattering and hence good effective resolution, and from correlations between pulse spectra, we show that the giant pulse emission regions are indeed resolved. We infer apparent diameters of $\sim\!2000$ and $\sim\!2400{\rm\;km}$ for the main and interpulse components, respectively, and show that with these sizes the correlation amplitudes and decorrelation timescales and bandwidths can be understood quantitatively, both in our observations and in previous ones. Using pulse-spectra statistics and correlations between polarizations, we also show that the nebula resolves the nanoshots that comprise individual giant pulses. The implied diameters of $\sim\!1100{\rm\;km}$ far exceed light travel-time estimates, suggesting the emitting plasma is moving relativistically, with $\gamma\simeq10^{4}$, as inferred previously from drifting bands during the scattering tail of a giant pulse. If so, the emission happens over a region extended along the line of sight by $\sim\!10^{7}{\rm\;km}$. We conclude that relativistic motion likely is important for producing giant pulses, and may be similarly for other sources of short, bright radio emission, such as fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

The dispersion measure of FRBs is defined as the electron column density along the line of sight, and accounts for every ionized baryon. Here we measure the baryon content of the Universe using 22 localized FRBs. Unlike previous works that fixed the value of dispersion measure of FRB host galaxies and ignored the inhomogeneities of the intergalactic medium (IGM), we use the probability distributions of dispersion measures contributed by host galaxies and IGM from the state-of-the-art IllustrisTNG simulations. We derive the cosmic baryon density of $\Omega_b=0.0490^{+0.0036}_{-0.0033}$ (1$\sigma$), with a precision of 7.0%. This value is dramatically consistent with other measurements, such as the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

arXiv:2211.03974,Daichi Hiramatsu et al.,Limits on Simultaneous and Delayed Optical Emission from Well-localized Fast Radio Bursts,"We present the largest compilation to date of optical observations during and following fast radio bursts (FRBs). The data set includes our dedicated simultaneous and follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous archival survey observations, for a sample of 15 well-localized FRBs: eight repeating and seven one-off sources. Our simultaneous (and nearly simultaneous with a $0.4$ s delay) optical observations of 13 (1) bursts from the repeating FRB 20220912A provide the deepest such limits to date for any extragalactic FRB, reaching a luminosity limit of $\nu L_\nu\lesssim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim 2\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with $15-400$ s exposures; an optical-flux-to-radio-fluence ratio of $f_{\rm opt}/F_{\rm radio}\lesssim 10^{-7}$ ms$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim 10^{-8}$ ms$^{-1}$); and flux ratio of $f_{\rm opt}/f_{\rm radio}\lesssim 0.02-\lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$ ($\lesssim 10^{-6}$) on millisecond to second timescales. These simultaneous limits provide useful constraints in the context of FRB emission models, such as the pulsar magnetosphere and pulsar nebula models. Interpreting all available optical limits in the context of the synchrotron maser model, we find that they constrain the flare energies to $\lesssim 10^{43}-10^{49}$ erg (depending on the distances of the various repeating FRBs, with $\lesssim 10^{39}$ erg for the Galactic SGR 1935+2154). These limits are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than those inferred from the FRBs themselves, although in the case of FRB 20220912A our simultaneous and rapid follow-up observations severely restrict the model parameter space.

arXiv:2211.03246,Mingyu Ge et al.,A giant glitch from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 before FRB 200428,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short pulses observed in radio frequencies usually originating from cosmological distances. The discovery of FRB 200428 and its X-ray counterpart from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 suggests that at least some FRBs can be generated by magnetars. However, the majority of X-ray bursts from magnetars are not associated with radio emission. The fact that only in rare cases can an FRB be generated raises the question regarding the special triggering mechanism of FRBs. Here we report a giant glitch from SGR J1935+2154, which occurred approximately $3.1\pm2.5$\,day before FRB 200428, with $\Delta\nu=19.8\pm1.4$ {\rm $\mu$Hz} and $\Delta\dot{\nu}=6.3\pm1.1$\,pHz s$^{-1}$. The corresponding spin-down power change rate $\Delta\dot\nu/\dot\nu$ is among the largest in all the detected pulsar glitches. The glitch contains a delayed spin-up process that is only detected in the Crab pulsar and the magnetar 1E 2259+586, a large persistent offset of the spin-down rate, and a recovery component which is about one order of magnitude smaller than the persistent one. The temporal coincidence between the glitch and FRB 200428 suggests a physical connection between the two. The internally triggered giant glitch of the magnetar likely altered the magnetosphere structure dramatically in favour of FRB generation, which subsequently triggered many X-ray bursts and eventually FRB 200428 through additional crustal cracking and Alfv\'en wave excitation and propagation.",astro-ph.HE

The CO observations resulted in the detection of CO(3-2) emission in the FRB20180924B host and non-detections of CO(3-2) and CO(2-1) emission in the hosts of FRB20190102C and FRB20190711A, respectively. The derived molecular gas mass and 3$\sigma$ upper limit is $(2.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$, $<3.8 \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, and $<6.7 \times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$ for the hosts of FRB20180924B, FRB20190102C, and FRB20190711A, respectively. We found diversity in molecular gas properties (gas mass, gas depletion time, and gas fraction to stellar mass) in the sample. Compared to other star-forming galaxies, the FRB20180924B host is gas-rich (the larger molecular gas fraction), and the hosts of FRB20190102C and FRB20200120E are gas-poor with a shorter depletion time for their stellar mass and star-formation rate. Our findings suggest that FRBs arise from multiple progenitors or single progenitors that can exist in a wide range of galaxy environments. Statistical analysis shows a significant difference in the distribution of molecular gas fraction between the FRB hosts and local star-forming galaxies. However, the difference is not substantial when an outlier, the FRB20200120E host, is excluded, and analysis with a larger sample is needed.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2211.02209,"Bao Wang, Jun-Jie Wei, ",An 8.0\% Determination of the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium from Localized Fast Radio Bursts,"The dispersion measure (DM)--redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been proposed as a potential new tool for probing intergalactic medium (IGM) and for studying cosmology. However, the poor knowledge of the baryon fraction in the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$) and its degeneracy with cosmological parameters impose restrictions on the cosmological applications of FRBs. Furthermore, DMs contributed by the IGM ($\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$) and host galaxy ($\mathrm{DM_{host}}$), important cosmological quantities, cannot be exactly extracted from observations, which would bring uncontrolled systematic uncertainties in FRB cosmology. In this work, we use seventeen localized FRBs to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ and its possible redshift evolution. Other cosmological probes such as type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background radiation are combined to break parameter degeneracy. Taking into account the probability distributions of $\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$ and $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ derived from the the IllustrisTNG simulation, we obtain a robust measurement of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}=0.927\pm0.075$, representing a precision of 8.0\%.

Our overarching goal is to offer a comprehensive resource for the examination of these ephemeral events, extending the X-ray duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS) to show luminosity evolution. We use existing observations (both targeted and serendipitous) to characterize the behavior of various transient/variable populations. Contextualizing transient signals in the larger DLPS serves two primary purposes: to identify areas of interest (i.e., regions in the parameter space where one would expect detections, but in which observations have historically been lacking) and to provide initial qualitative guidance in classifying newly discovered transient signals. We find that while the most luminous (largely extragalactic) and least luminous (largely Galactic) part of the phase space is well-populated at $t > 0.1$ days, intermediate luminosity phenomena (L$_x = 10^{34} - 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) represent a gap in the phase space.

arXiv:2211.00940,"Surajit Kalita, Amanda Weltman, ",Continuous gravitational wave detection to understand the generation mechanism of fast radio bursts,"Since the unexpected discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs), researchers have proposed varied theories and models to explain these phenomena. One such model that has recently been developed incorporates the so-called Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect, which states that when gravitational waves traverse a pulsar magnetosphere, a portion of the gravitational radiation is transformed into electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The observed properties of FRBs are consistent with the properties of this EM radiation, implying, remarkably, that the GZ effect can account for both repeating and non-repeating FRBs. If this model is correct, the pulsar's properties should not change over time, and it would continue to emit both EM dipole and gravitational quadrupole radiation for a long period of time. This article targets the gravitational radiation produced by the pulsar mechanism and shows that several proposed gravitational wave detectors can detect these gravitational waves. If such detections are performed in the future from the location of FRBs, it might validate the GZ process for FRB production and potentially rule out several other theories of FRB generation.",astro-ph.HE

Based on simulations in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects, we analyze the DM of FRBs contributed by the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium in the hosts, $\rm{DM_{host}}$. We explore two population models - tracing the star formation rate (SFR), and the stellar mass, i.e. young and old progenitors respectively. The distribution of $\rm{DM_{host}}$ shows significant differences at $z=0$ between two populations: the stellar mass model exhibits an excess at the low DM end with respect to the SFR model. The SFR (stellar mass) model has a median value of $\rm{DM_{host}}$=179 (63) $\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$ for galaxies with $M_*=10^{8-13}\,M_{\odot}$ in the TNG100-1. Galaxies in the Illustris-1 have a much smaller $\rm{DM_{host}}$. The distributions of $\rm{DM_{host}}$ deviate from log-normal function for both models. Furthermore, two populations differ moderately in the spatial offset from host galaxy's center, in the stellar mass function of hosts. $\rm{DM_{host}}$ increases with the stellar mass of hosts when $M_*<10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}$, and fluctuate at higher mass. At $0<z<2$, $\rm{DM_{host}}$ increases with redshift. The differences in $\rm{DM_{host}}$ between two populations declines with increasing redshift. With more localized events available in the future, statistics such as $\rm{DM_{host}}$, the offset from galaxy center and the stellar mass function of hosts will be of great helpful to ascertain the origin of FRB. Meanwhile, statistics of $\rm{DM_{host}}$ of localized FRB events could help to constrain the baryon physics models in galaxy evolution.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2210.13509,"Andrei M.

The perturbations are typically in the kHz band and excite magnetohydrodynamic waves. We show that compressive magnetospheric waves steepen into monster shocks, possibly the strongest shocks in the universe. The shocks are radiative, i.e. the plasma energy is radiated before it crosses the shock. As the kHz wave with the radiative shock expands through the magnetosphere, it produces a bright X-ray burst. Then, it launches an approximately adiabatic blast wave, which will expand far from the neutron star. These results suggest a new mechanism for X-ray bursts from magnetars and support the connection of magnetar X-ray activity with fast radio bursts. Similar shocks may persistently occur in magnetized neutron-star binaries, generating an X-ray precursor of the binary merger. Powerful radiative shocks are also predicted in the magnetosphere of a neutron star when it collapses into a black hole, producing a bright X-ray transient.",astro-ph.HE

Younes et al.,Magnetar spin-down glitch clearing the way for FRB-like bursts and a pulsed radio episode,"Magnetars are a special subset of the isolated neutron star family, with X-ray and radio emission mainly powered by the decay of their immense magnetic fields. Many attributes of magnetars remain poorly understood: spin-down glitches or the sudden reductions in the star's angular momentum, radio bursts reminiscent of extra-galactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and transient pulsed radio emission lasting months to years. Here we unveil the detection of a large spin-down glitch event ($|\Delta\nu/\nu| = 5.8_{-1.6}^{+2.6}\times10^{-6}$) from the magnetar SGR~1935+2154 on 2020 October 5 (+/- 1 day). We find no change to the source persistent surface thermal or magnetospheric X-ray behavior, nor is there evidence of strong X-ray bursting activity. Yet, in the subsequent days, the magnetar emitted three FRB-like radio bursts followed by a month long episode of pulsed radio emission. Given the rarity of spin-down glitches and radio signals from magnetars, their approximate synchronicity suggests an association, providing pivotal clues to their origin and triggering mechanisms, with ramifications to the broader magnetar and FRB populations. We postulate that impulsive crustal plasma shedding close to the magnetic pole generates a wind that combs out magnetic field lines, rapidly reducing the star's angular momentum, while temporarily altering the magnetospheric field geometry to permit the pair creation needed to precipitate radio emission.",astro-ph.HE

The construction of Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is being proposed to solve these challenges. We simulate mock Galactic FRB-like events by applying a range of spatial distributions, pulse widths and luminosity functions. The effect of turbulent Interstellar Medium (ISM) on the detectability of FRB-like events within the Milky Way plane is considered to estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events. We evaluate the fraction of FRB-like events in the Milky Way that are detectable by BURSTT and compare the result with those by Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) and Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX). We find that BURSTT could increase the detection rate by more than two orders of magnitude compared with STARE2 and GReX, depending on the slope of luminosity function of the events. We also investigate the influence of the specifications of BURSTT on its detection improvement. This leads to the fact that greatly higher sensitivity and improved coverage of the Milky Way plane have significant effects on the detection improvement of BURSTT. We find that the upgrade version of BURSTT, BURSTT-2048 could increase the detection rate of faint Galactic FRB-like events by a factor of 3.",astro-ph.HE

We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder. The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection. By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar. We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A.

As such they are sensitive to significant magnification via gravitational lensing from a class of lenses which are not well-constrained by observations today. Low-mass primordial black holes are one such candidate which may constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's dark matter. Current observations only constrain their density in the nearby Universe, giving fast transients from cosmological distances the potential to form complementary constraints. Motivated by this, we calculate the effect that gravitational lensing from a cosmological distribution of compact objects would have on the observed rates of FRBs and GRBs. For static lensing geometries, we rule out the prospect that all FRBs are gravitationally lensed for a range of lens masses and show that lens masses greater than $10^{-5}M_\odot$ can be constrained with 8000 un-localised high fluence FRBs at 1.4GHz, as might be detected by the next generation of FRB-finding telescopes.",astro-ph.CO

We argue that GLEAM-X J1627 is a highly-magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra long period magnetar - ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either a magnetically or a rotationally-powered white dwarf. By studying these sources together with previously detected objects, we find there are at least a handful of promising candidates for Galactic ULPMs. The detections of these objects imply a substantial number, $N \gtrsim 13000$ and $N \gtrsim 500$ for PSR J0901--4046 like and GLEAM-X J1627 like objects, respectively, within our Galaxy. These source densities, as well as cooling age limits from non-detection of thermal X-rays, Galactic offsets, timing stability and dipole spindown limits, all imply the ULPM candidates are substantially older than confirmed Galactic magnetars and that their formation channel is a common one. Their existence implies widespread survival of magnetar-like fields for several Myr, distinct from the inferred behaviour in confirmed Galactic magnetars. ULPMs may also constitute a second class of FRB progenitors which could naturally exhibit very long periodic activity windows. Finally, we show that existing radio campaigns are biased against detecting objects like these and discuss strategies for future radio and X-ray surveys to identify more such objects.

We study the filamentation of FRBs in the relativistic winds of magnetars, which are commonly invoked as the most natural FRB progenitors. As a result of filamentation, the particle number density and the radiation intensity develop strong gradients along the direction of the wind magnetic field. A steady state is reached when the plasma pressure balances the ponderomotive force. In such a steady state, particles are confined into periodically spaced thin sheets, and electromagnetic waves propagate between them as in a waveguide. We show that: (i) The dispersion relation resembles that in the initial homogeneous plasma, but the effective plasma frequency is determined by the separation of the sheets, not directly by the mean particle density. (ii) The contribution of relativistic magnetar winds to the dispersion measure of FRBs could be several orders of magnitude larger than previously thought. The dispersion measure of the wind depends on the properties of individual bursts (e.g. the luminosity), and therefore can change significantly among different bursts from repeating FRBs.

If we fix the FRB properties, about $10^5$ FRB data can give constraints on $\beta$ tighter than the current cosmic microwave background data in the IDE models with the interaction proportional to the energy density of dark energy. In all the IDE models, about $10^6$ FRB data can achieve the absolute errors of $\beta$ to less than $0.10$, providing a way to precisely measure $\beta$ by only one cosmological probe. Jointly constraining the FRB properties and cosmological parameters would increase the constraint errors of $\beta$ by a factor of about 0.5-2.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2210.07159,"Kyle Boone, Matthew McQuinn, ",Solar System-scale interferometry on fast radio bursts could measure cosmic distances with sub-percent precision,"The light from a source at a distance d will arrive at detectors separated by 100 AU at times that differ by as much as 120 (d/100 Mpc)^{-1} nanoseconds because of the curvature of the wavefront. At gigahertz frequencies, the arrival time difference can be determined to better than a nanosecond with interferometry. If the space-time positions of the detectors are known to a few centimeters, comparable to the accuracy to which very long baseline interferometry baselines and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) geolocations are constrained, nanosecond timing would allow competitive cosmological constraints. We show that a four-detector constellation at Solar radii of >10 AU could measure distances to individual sources with sub-percent precision and, hence, cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant to this precision. The precision increases quadratically with baseline length. FRBs are the only known bright extragalactic radio source that are sufficiently point-like. Galactic scattering limits the timing precision at <3 GHz, whereas at higher frequencies the precision is set by removing dispersion. Furthermore, for baselines greater than 100 AU, Shapiro time delays limit the precision, but their effect can be cleaned with two additional detectors. Accelerations that result in ~1 cm uncertainty in detector positions (from variations in the Sun's irradiance, dust collisions and gaseous drag) could be corrected for with weekly GNSS-like trilaterations. Gravitational accelerations from asteroids occur over longer timescales, and so a setup with a precise accelerometer and calibrating the detector positions off of distant FRBs may also be sufficient. The proposed interferometer would also resolve the radio emission region of Galactic pulsars, constrain the mass distribution in the outer Solar System, and reach interesting sensitivities to ~0.01-100 micro-Hz gravitational waves.",astro-ph.CO

We place the earliest radio limits on persistent emission following the low-luminosity fast radio burst FRB 200428 from the magnetar. We also perform an image-plane search for transient emission and find no radio flares during our observations. We examine post-FRB radio upper limits in the literature and find that all are consistent with the multi-wavelength afterglow predicted by the synchrotron maser shock model interpretation of FRB 200428. However, early optical observations appear to rule out the simple versions of the afterglow model with constant-density circumburst media. We show that these constraints may be mitigated by adapting the model for a wind-like environment, but only for a limited parameter range. In addition, we suggest that late-time non-thermal particle acceleration occurs within the afterglow model when the shock is no longer relativistic, which may prove vital for detecting afterglows from other Galactic FRBs. We also discuss future observing strategies for verifying either magnetospheric or maser shock FRB models via rapid radio observations of Galactic magnetars and nearby FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

This value, which is independent of the cosmological model, is consistent with the results from the nearby type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data calibrated by Cepheids and the Planck cosmic microwave background radiation observations at the $1\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ confidence level, respectively. Simulations show that the uncertainty of $H_0$ can be decreased to the level of that from the nearby SN Ia when mock data from 500 localized FRBs with 50 Hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range of $0<z\leq1$ are used. Since localized FRBs are expected to be detected in large quantities, our method will be able to give a reliable and more precise determination of $H_0$ in the very near future, which will help us to figure out the possible origin of the Hubble constant disagreement.",astro-ph.CO

arXiv:2210.04907,Kyle Kremer et al.,Prospects for Detecting Fast Radio Bursts in Globular Clusters of Nearby Galaxies,"The recent detection of a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) in an old globular cluster in M81 challenges traditional FRB formation mechanisms based on magnetic activity in young neutron stars formed recently in core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the detection of this repeater in such a nearby galaxy implies a high local universe rate of similar events in globular clusters. Building off the properties inferred from the M81 FRB, we predict the number of FRB sources in nearby ($d \lesssim 20\,$Mpc) galaxies with large globular cluster systems known. Incorporating the uncertain burst energy distribution, we estimate the rate of bursts detectable in these galaxies by radio instruments such as FAST and MeerKat. Of all local galaxies, we find M87 is the best candidate for FRB detections. We predict M87's globular cluster system contains $\mathcal{O}(10)$ FRB sources at present and that a dedicated radio survey (by FAST or MeerKat) of $\mathcal{O}(10)\,$hr has a $90\%$ probability of detecting a globular cluster FRB in M87. The detection of even a handful of additional globular cluster FRBs would provide invaluable constraints on FRB mechanisms and population properties. Previous studies have demonstrated young neutron stars formed following collapse of dynamically-formed massive white dwarf binary mergers may provide the most natural mechanism for these bursts. We explore the white dwarf merger scenario using a suite of $N$-body cluster models, focusing in particular on such mergers in M87 clusters. We describe a number of outstanding features of this scenario that in principle may be testable with an ensemble of observed FRBs in nearby globular clusters.",astro-ph.HE

Here we report the discovery of a burst, FRB20220610A, in a complex host galaxy system at a redshift of $z=1.016 \pm 0.002$. The relationship between its redshift and dispersion confirm that the bulk of the baryonic matter was ionized and in the intergalactic medium when the universe was almost half its present age.

arXiv:2210.04401,Wei-Yang Wang et al.,Polarisation of magnetospheric curvature radiation in repeating fast radio bursts,"Fast radio busts (FRBs) can exhibit a wide variety of polarisation properties, not only between sources but also from burst to burst for a same one. In this work, we revisit the polarisation characters of coherent curvature radiation from a bulk of charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a highly magnetized neutron star. FRBs have been observed to have a variety of polarisation features, such as high levels of circular polarisation or a sign change of circular polarisation. High linear polarisation would appear when the line of sight is inside the emission beam (the on-beam geometry), whereas high circular polarisation would be present when it is outside (the off-beam geometry). By considering two scenarios of the ``bulk shapes'' (thick vs. thin), we apply the model to explain the polarisation features of three repeating FRBs (FRB 20201124A, FRB 20190520B and FRB 20121102A). Most bursts are dominated by linear polarisation and negligible events have sign changes in circular polarisation, suggesting that such FRBs are most likely to be emitted by the ``thin'' bulks with large opening angles. The higher probability of ``thin'' bulks could be meaningful for understanding repeating FRB central engine, i.e., the sparking dynamics to produce different bulks of energetic bunches on a neutron star surface.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2210.03645,Yong-Kun Zhang et al.,FAST observations of an extremely active episode of FRB 20201124A: II. Energy Distribution,"We report the properties of more than 800 bursts detected from the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20201124A with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during an extremely active episode on UTC September 25-28, 2021 in a series of four papers. In this second paper of the series, we mainly focus on the energy distribution of the detected bursts. The event rate initially increased exponentially but the source activity stopped within 24 hours after the 4th day. The detection of 542 bursts in one hour during the fourth day marked the highest event rate detected from one single FRB source so far. The bursts have complex structures in the time-frequency space. We find a double-peak distribution of the waiting time, which can be modeled with two log-normal functions peaking at 51.22 ms and 10.05 s, respectively. Compared with the emission from a previous active episode of the source detected with FAST, the second distribution peak time is smaller, suggesting that this peak is defined by the activity level of the source. We calculate the isotropic energy of the bursts using both a partial bandwidth and a full bandwidth and find that the energy distribution is not significantly changed. We find that an exponentially connected broken-power-law function can fit the cumulative burst energy distribution well, with the lower and higher-energy indices being $-1.22\pm0.01$ and $-4.27\pm0.23$, respectively. Assuming a radio radiative efficiency of $\eta_r = 10^{-4}$, the total isotropic energy of the bursts released during the four days when the source was active is already $3.9\times10^{46}$ erg, exceeding $\sim 23\%$ of the available magnetar dipolar magnetic energy. This challenges the magnetar models invoking an inefficient radio emission (e.g. synchrotron maser models).",astro-ph.HE

Spin Period Search,"We report the properties of more than 800 bursts detected from the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20201124A with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio telescope (FAST) during an extremely active episode on UTC September 25th-28th, 2021 in a series of four papers. In this fourth paper of the series, we present a systematic search of the spin period and linear acceleration of the source object from both 996 individual pulse peaks and the dedispersed time series. No credible spin period was found from this data set. We rule out the presence of significant periodicity in the range between 1 ms to 100 s with a pulse duty cycle $< 0.49\pm0.08$ (when the profile is defined by a von-Mises function, not a boxcar function) and linear acceleration up to $300$ m s$^{-2}$ in each of the four one-hour observing sessions, and up to $0.6$ m s$^{-2}$ in all 4 days. These searches contest theoretical scenarios involving a 1 ms to 100 s isolated magnetar/pulsar with surface magnetic field $<10^{15}$ G and a small duty cycle (such as in a polar-cap emission mode) or a pulsar with a companion star or black hole up to 100 M$_{\rm \odot}$ and $P_b>10$ hours. We also perform a periodicity search of the fine structures and identify 53 unrelated millisecond-timescale ""periods"" in multi-components with the highest significance of 3.9 $\sigma$. The ""periods"" recovered from the fine structures are neither consistent nor harmonically related. Thus they are not likely to come from a spin period. We caution against claiming spin periodicity with significance below $\sim$ 4 $\sigma$ with multi-components from one-off FRBs. We discuss the implications of our results and the possible connections between FRB multi-components and pulsar micro-structures.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2210.03609,Jin-Chen Jiang et al.,FAST observations of an extremely active episode of FRB 20201124A: III. Polarimetry,"As the third paper in the multiple-part series, we report the statistical properties of radio bursts detected from the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20201124A with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio telescope (FAST) during an extremely active episode between the 25th and the 28th of September 2021 (UT). We focus on the polarisation properties of 536 bright bursts with $\mathrm{S/N}>50$. We found that the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) monotonically dropped from $-579 \ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ to $-605 \ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ in the 4-day window. The RM values were compatible with the values ($-300$ to $-900\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ ) reported 4 month ago (Xu et al. 2022). However, the RM evolution rate in the current observation window was at least an order of magnitude smaller than the one ($\sim 500\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}\, day^{-1}}$) previously reported during the rapid RM-variation phase, but is still higher than the one ($\le 1\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2} day^{-1}}$ ) during the later RM no-evolution phase. The bursts of FRB 20201124A were highly polarised with the total degree of polarisation (circular plus linear) greater than 90% for more than 90\% of all bursts. The distribution of linear polarisation position angles (PAs), degree of linear polarisation ($L/I$), and degree of circular polarisation ($V/I$) can be characterised with unimodal distribution functions. During the observation window, the distributions became wider with time, i.e. with larger scatter, but the centroids of the distribution functions remained nearly constant. For individual bursts, significant PA variations (confidence level 5-$\sigma$) were observed in 33% of all bursts. The polarisation of single pulses seems to follow certain complex trajectories on the Poincar\'e sphere, which may shed light on the radiation mechanism at the source or the plasma properties along the path of FRB propagation.",astro-ph.HE

The observations were carried out in the band of 1.0 - 1.5 GHz by using the center beam of the L-band 19-beam receiver. We monitored the source in sixteen 1-hour sessions and one 3-hour session spanning 23 days. All the bursts were detected during the first four days. In this first paper of the series, we perform a detailed morphological study of 624 bursts using the 2-dimensional frequency-time ``waterfall'' plots, with a burst (or cluster-burst) defined as an emission episode during which the adjacent emission peaks have a separation shorter than 400 ms. The duration of a burst is therefore always longer than 1 ms, with the longest up to more than 120 ms. The emission spectra of the sub-bursts are typically narrow within the observing band with a characteristic width of $\sim$277 MHz. The center frequency distribution has a dominant peak at about 1091.9 MHz and a secondary weak peak around 1327.9 MHz. Most bursts show a frequency-downward-drifting pattern. Based on the drifting patterns, we classify the bursts into five main categories: downward drifting (263) bursts, upward drifting (3) bursts, complex (203), no drifting (35) bursts, and no evidence for drifting (121) bursts. Subtypes are introduced based on the emission frequency range in the band (low, middle, high and wide) as well as the number of components in one burst (1, 2, or multiple).

These clusters reveal the differences between repeaters and non-repeaters. Then, by comparing with the identities of the FRBs in the observed classes, we evaluate the performance of various algorithms and analyze the physical meaning behind the results.

In a series of two papers, we attempt to disentangle this mystery with machine learning methods. In this first paper, we focus on an array of supervised machine learning methods. We train the machine learning algorithms with a fraction of the observed FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, telling them which ones are apparently non-repeating and which ones are repeating. We then let the trained models predict the repetitiveness of the rest of the FRB data with the observed parameters, and we compare the predictions with the observed repetitiveness. We find that the models can predict most FRBs correctly, hinting towards distinct mechanisms behind repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We also find that the two most important distinguishing factors between non-repeating and repeating FRBs are brightness temperature and rest-frame frequency bandwidth. By applying the trained models back to the entire first CHIME catalog, we further identify some potentially repeating FRBs currently reported as non-repeating.

Based on recently published data in the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 in the frequency bands 400-800 MHz, we analyze 125 apparently singular FRBs with low dispersion measure (DM) and find that the distribution of their luminosity follows a lognormal form according to statistical tests. In our luminosity measurement, the FRB distance is estimated by using the Macquart relation which was obtained for 8 localized FRBs, and we find it still applicable for 18 sources after adding the latest 10 new localized FRBs. In addition, we test the validity of the luminosity distribution up to the Macquart relation and find that the lognormal form feature decreases as the uncertainty increases. Moreover, we compare the luminosity of these apparent non-repeaters with that of the previously observed 10 repeating FRBs also at low DM, noting that they belong to different lognormal distributions with the mean luminosity of non-repeaters being two times greater than that of repeaters. Therefore, from the two different lognormal distributions, different mechanisms for FRBs can be implied.",astro-ph.HE

Ocker et al.,Scattering variability detected from the circumsource medium of FRB 20190520B,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-timescale radio transients, the origins of which are predominantly extragalactic and likely involve highly magnetized compact objects. FRBs undergo multipath propagation, or scattering, from electron density fluctuations on sub-parsec scales in ionized gas along the line-of-sight. Scattering observations have located plasma structures within FRB host galaxies, probed Galactic and extragalactic turbulence, and constrained FRB redshifts. Scattering also inhibits FRB detection and biases the observed FRB population. We report the detection of scattering times from the repeating FRB 20190520B that vary by up to a factor of two or more on minutes to days-long timescales. In one notable case, the scattering time varied from $7.9\pm0.4$ ms to less than 3.1 ms ($95\%$ confidence) over 2.9 minutes at 1.45 GHz. The scattering times appear to be uncorrelated between bursts or with dispersion and rotation measure variations. Scattering variations are attributable to dynamic, inhomogeneous plasma in the circumsource medium, and analogous variations have been observed from the Crab pulsar. Under such circumstances, the frequency dependence of scattering can deviate from the typical power-law used to measure scattering. Similar variations may therefore be detectable from other FRBs, even those with inconspicuous scattering, providing a unique probe of small-scale processes within FRB environments.",astro-ph.HE

Many XRBs have been detected from the source, but very few were found to be associated with bursty radio emission. Meanwhile, a number of weaker radio bursts have been detected from the source, which could in principle be slow radio bursts (SRBs): FRBs detected at viewing angles outside the FRB jet cone. In this paper, we use these X-ray and radio observations to constrain the geometric and relativistic beaming factors of FRBs under two hypotheses. First, we assume that all SRBs should be associated with XRBs like FRB 200428. We use the FRB-SRB closure relations to identify two SRBs and derive that FRB beaming must be geometrically narrow, $\theta_j \lesssim 10^{-2}$ rad, and follow $\theta_j\Gamma\sim2$. Second, we assume a less stringent constraint for SRBs by not requiring that they are associated with XRBs. We identify a total of seven SRBs, five of which have Gaussian-like spectra, and derive that FRB beaming factors again follow $\theta_j\Gamma\sim2$.",astro-ph.HE

We investigate 167 bursts from FRB 20121102A spanning frequencies 1--7.5GHz, durations of less than 1 ms to approximately 10 ms, with low and high energies, and with different wait-times. We find from this sample of bursts a strong agreement with the inverse relationship between sub-burst slope and duration and with other predictions made by the triggered relativistic dynamical model (TRDM). Earlier results found agreement with those predictions across three different repeating FRB sources. For this sample of bursts, we find that the sub-burst slope as well as the 'sad trombone' drift rate are consistent with being in a quadratic relationship with frequency and that both these quantities are inversely proportional to the duration. We also find that the duration decreases with increasing frequency as well as a statistically significant correlation between the sub-burst duration and bandwidth (proportional to $t^{-1/2}$) that is unexpected. No distinct group of bursts in this sample deviated from these relationships, however significant scatter can be seen in measurements. This study demonstrates the consistent existence of relationships between the spectro-temporal properties of bursts from a repeating FRB source. A simple explanation for the inverse relation between the sub-burst slope and duration is an inherently narrowband emission process.

arXiv:2209.15113,Alexandra G. Mannings et al.,Fast Radio Bursts as Probes of Magnetic Fields in Galaxies at z < 0.5,"We present a sample of nine Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from which we derive magnetic field strengths of the host galaxies represented by normal, $z<0.5$ star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $M_* \approx 10^8 -10^{10.5} M_\odot$. We find no correlation between the FRB rotation measure(RM) and redshift which indicates that the RM values are due mostly to the FRB host contribution. This assertion is further supported by strong correlations (Spearman test probabilities $P_S \simeq 0.05$) found between RM and the estimated host dispersion measure ($DM_{Host}$) and host-normalized galacto-centric offset (Spearman $r_S$ values equal to 0.64 and -0.52). For these nine galaxies, we estimate their magnetic field strengths projected along the sightline $B$ finding a low median value of $0.5 \mu G$. This implies the magnetic fields of our sample of hosts are weaker than those characteristic of the Solar neighborhood ($\approx 6 \mu G$), but relatively consistent with a lower limit on observed range of $2-10 \mu G$ for star-forming, disk galaxies, especially as we consider reversals in the B-field, and that we are only probing $B_{\parallel}$. We compare to RMs from simulated galaxies of the Auriga project -- magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations - and find that the simulations predict the observed values to within the $95\%$ CI. Upcoming FRB surveys will provide hundreds of new FRBs with high-precision localizations, rotation measures, and imaging follow-up to support further investigation on the magnetic fields of a diverse population of $z<1$ galaxies.",astro-ph.GA

Here, we study the RM variations caused by stellar winds, and a possible stellar disc. If the magnetic field is radial in the stellar wind, RM will not reverse except if the magnetic axis inclination angle is close to $90 ^\circ$. For the toroidal magnetic field in the wind, RM will reverse at the super conjunction. For the case of the toroidal field in the disc, the RM variations may have a multimodal and multiple reversal profile because the radio signals travel through different components of the disc during periastron passage. We also apply this model to FRB 20180916B. By assuming its 16.35-day period is from a slowly rotating or freely precessing magnetar, we find that the secular RM variation can be explained by the periastron passage of a magnetar in a massive binary system. In addition, the clumps in the stellar wind and disc can cause short time-scale ($< 1$ day) variations or reversals of RM. Therefore, long-term monitoring of RM variations can reveal the environments of repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2209.04774,Qiao-Chu Li et al.,Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with High Burst Rates by Plate Collisions in Neutron Star Crusts,"Some repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources show high burst rates, and the physical origin is still unknown. Outstandingly, the first repeater FRB 121102 appears extremely high burst rate with the maximum value reaching $122\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$ or even higher. In this work, we propose that the high burst rate of an FRB repeater may be due to plate collisions in the crust of young neutron stars (NSs). In the crust of an NS, vortex lines are pinned to the lattice nuclei. When the relative angular velocity between the superfluid neutrons and the NS lattices is nonzero, a pinned force will act on the vortex lines, which will cause the lattice displacement and the strain on the NS crust growing. With the spin evolution, the crustal strain reaches a critical value, then the crust may crack into plates, and each of plates will collide with its adjacent ones. The Aflv\'en wave could be launched by the plate collisions and further produce FRBs. In this scenario, the predicted burst rate can reach $\sim 770\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ for an NS with the magnetic field of $10^{13}\,\rm{G}$ and the spin period of $0.01\,\rm{s}$. We further apply this model to FRB 121102, and predict the waiting time and energy distribution to be $P(t_{\mathrm{w}}) \propto t_{\text{w}}^{\alpha_{t_{\text{w}}}}$ with $\alpha_{t_{\text{w}}} \simeq -1.75$ and $N(E)\text{d}E \propto E^{\alpha_{E}}\text{d}E$ with $\alpha_{E} \simeq -1.67$, respectively. These properties are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2209.04455,"Xiaohan Wu, Matthew McQuinn, ",A measurement of circumgalactic gas around nearby galaxies using fast radio bursts,"The distribution of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies of all types is poorly constrained. Foreground CGMs contribute an extra amount to the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRB). We measure this DM excess for the CGMs of $10^{11}-10^{13}\ M_\odot$ halos using the CHIME/FRB first data release, a halo mass range that is challenging to probe in any other way. Because of the uncertainty in the FRBs' angular coordinates, only for nearby galaxies is the localization sufficient to confidently associate them with intersecting any foreground halo. Thus we stack on galaxies within 80 Mpc, optimizing the stacking scheme to approximately minimize the stack's variance and marginalize over uncertainties in FRB locations. The sample has 20-30 FRBs intersecting halos with masses of $10^{11}-10^{12}\ M_\odot$ and also of $10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_\odot$, and these intersections allow a marginal $1-2\,\sigma$ detection of the DM excess in both mass bins. The $10^{11}-10^{12}\ M_\odot$ halos bin also shows a DM excess at 1-2 virial radii. By comparing data with different models for the CGM gas profile, we find that all models are favored by the data up to 2-$\sigma$ level compared to the null hypothesis of no DM excess. With 2000-3000 more bursts from a future CHIME data release, we project a 4-$\sigma$ detection of the CGM. Distinguishing between viable CGM models by stacking FRBs with CHIME-like localization would require tens of thousands of bursts.",astro-ph.GA

The enormous data volumes produced by recent high-time resolution, radio-telescope surveys imply that efficient algorithms are required for a discovery. Such algorithms are usually tuned to detect specific, known sources. Existing data sets therefore likely contain unknown astronomical sources, which will remain undetected unless algorithms are developed that can detect a more diverse range of signals. We present the Single-dish PARKES data challenge for finding the uneXpected (SPARKESX), a compilation of real and simulated high-time resolution observations. SPARKESX comprises three mock surveys from the Parkes ""Murriyang"" radio telescope. A broad selection of simulated and injected expected signals (such as pulsars, fast radio bursts), poorly characterised signals (plausible flare star signatures) and unknown unknowns are generated for each survey. The goal of this challenge is to aid in the development of new algorithms that can detect a wide-range of source types. We show how successful a typical pipeline based on the standard pulsar search software, PRESTO, is at finding the injected signals.

Timing and polarisation analysis of relativistic binaries can place strong constraints on theories of gravity. The observation of a growing number of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) spread over the celestial sphere may allow the detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background arising from supermassive black hole binaries. A more complete sample of young pulsars improves our knowledge of neutron star birth and evolution. Transients such as fast radio bursts can serve to probe the intergalactic medium. The SPAN512 pulsar survey covers intermediate Galactic latitudes using the L-band receiver of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT). The survey covers 224 sq. deg. of the sky for a total exposure time of 2200 h. Population syntheses predict the discovery of 3 to 19 new normal pulsars and a few MSPs. We present detailed modelling of the NRT beam with its L-band receiver and its sensitivity which we used to precisely assess the expected survey yield. We used the flexible Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array data processing pipeline to search the 47 TB of SPAN512 data for pulsars and transients. The SPAN512 survey discovered two new MSPs and one new middle-aged pulsar. We focus on the analysis of the 2.4-ms spin period pulsar J2205+6012 for which we also report the detection of gamma-ray pulsations.

Applying our model to magnetar bursts with fast radio bursts (FRBs), in particular the X-ray short bursts from SGR 1935+2154 associated with the Galactic FRB 20200428A, we show that the burst radiation can accelerate the outflow to high Lorentz factor with sufficient energy to power FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

At the same time, the classification of FRBs is currently an imperative issue. We propose that the brightness temperature of bursts can serve as an ideal criterion for classification. In this work, we gather the available data for all localized FRBs and we find a positive relation between the intrinsic pulse width and burst energy, $T_{\rm i}\propto E_\nu^{0.25}$, for three repeating FRBs that is similar to that of our previous work using FRB 20121102A data alone. The critical line $T_{\rm B,cri}$ is found to vary for different FRBs, which may reflect the differences in source properties. This relation can put strong constraints on mainstream radiation mechanisms. It is evident that neither the coherent curvature radiation or synchrotron maser radiation have the capability to reach the high brightness temperature required to reproduce this relation.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2208.13868,Fang Xi Lin et al.,Plasma lensing near the eclipses of the Black Widow pulsar B1957+20,"Recently, several eclipsing millisecond pulsars have been shown to experience strong and apparent weak lensing from the outflow of their ionized companions. Lensing can be a powerful probe of the ionized plasma, with the strongest lenses potentially resolving emission regions of pulsars. Understanding lensing in the `laboratory-like' conditions of an eclipsing pulsar may be analogously applied to fast radio bursts, many of which reside in dense, magnetized environments. We examined variable dispersion measure (DM), absorption, scattering, and flux density in the original Black Widow pulsar PSR B1957+20 through an eclipse at the Arecibo Observatory at 327 MHz. We discovered clear evidence of the two regimes of lensing, strong and apparent weak. We show that the flux density variations in the apparently weak lensing regime can be modeled directly from variations of DM, using geometric optics. The mean effective velocities in the ingress, $954\pm 99$ km/s, and egress $604\pm 47$ km/s cannot be explained by orbital motions alone, but are consistent with significant outflow velocity of material from the companion. We also show that geometric optics can predict when and where the lensing regime-change between weak and strong occurs, and argue that the apparent weak lensing is due to averaging many images. Our framework can be applied in any source with variable electron columns, measuring their relative velocities and distances. In other eclipsing pulsars, this provides a unique opportunity to measure companion outflow velocity, predict regions of weak and strong lensing, and in principle independently constrain orbital inclinations.",astro-ph.HE

Motivated by the complex structure on multiple time scales seen in FRBs, DM-power optimizes the DM by combining measurements at multiple Fourier frequencies in the power spectrum of the burst. By optimally weighting the measurements at each Fourier frequency, DM-power finds a burst DM that effectively incorporates information on many different burst timescales. We validate this technique on simulated Gaussian pulse profiles with a precision down to $\sigma_{\rm DM} \sim 0.001~{\rm pc~cm}^{-3}$, and then apply it to bursts from pulsar B0329+54 and FRB~20180916B. The precision of these DM measurements are sufficient to measure a statistically significant variation in DM over a $\approx 2$ hr span. While this variation could be the result of electron density variations along the line of sight, it is more like that the observed variation is the result of intrinsic frequency-dependent burst structure that can mimic a dispersive delay.",astro-ph.HE

Recently, the time-delay cosmography from strong lensing and the stellar kinematics of the deflector, which encode the Hubble constant and the post-Newtonian parameter via two distance ratios reflecting the lensing mass and dynamical mass respectively, have been proposed to investigate these two parameters simultaneously. Among strong lensing systems with different sources, strongly lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been proposed as precision probes of the universe since the time delay $\sim$ 10 days between images could be measured extremely precisely because of their short duration of a few milliseconds. In this work, we investigate the ability of strongly lensed FRBs on simultaneously estimating these two parameters via simulations. Take the expected FRB detection rate of upcoming facilities and lensing probability into consideration, it is likely to accumulate 10 lensed FRBs in several years and we find that $H_0$ could be determined to a $\sim1.5\%$ precision and $\gamma_{\rm PPN}$ could be constrained to a $\sim8.7\%$ precision simultaneously from them.

Most ULXBs are observational one-off bursts, whereas five flares from the same source in NGC 5128 were discovered by Irwin et al. (2016). In this Letter, we propose a neutron star (NS)-white dwarf (WD) binary model with super-Eddington accretion rates to explain the repeating behavior of the ULXB source in NGC 5128. With an eccentric orbit, the mass transfer occurs at the periastron where the WD fills its Roche lobe. The ultraluminous X-ray flares can be produced by the accretion column around the NS magnetic poles. On the other hand, some repeating fast radio bursts (hereafter FRBs) were also found in extragalactic globular clusters. Repeating ULXBs and repeating FRBs are the most violent bursts in the X-ray and radio bands, respectively. We propose a possible association between the repeating ULXBs and the repeating FRBs. Such an association is worth further investigation by follow-up observations on nearby extragalactic globular clusters.",astro-ph.HE

It is natural to speculate that a class of merging neutron star binaries may have FRB emitters. In this work, we study the observational aspects of these binaries - particularly those with FRB repeaters, which are promising multi-band and multi-messenger observation targets of radio telescopes and ground based gravitational wave detectors as the former telescopes can probe the systems at a much earlier stage in the inspiral than the latter. We show that observations of FRB repeaters in compact binaries have a significant advantage in pinning down the binary spin dynamics, constraining neutron star equation of state, probing FRB production mechanisms, and testing beyond standard physics. As a proof of principle, we investigate several mock observations of FRB pulses originating from pre-merger neutron star binaries, and we find that using the information of FRB arriving times alone, the intrinsic parameters of this system (including the stellar masses, spins, and quadrupole moments) can be measured with high precision, and the angular dependence of the FRB emission pattern can also be well reconstructed. The measurement of stellar masses (with an error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-5})$) and quadrupole moments (with an error of $\mathcal{O}(1\%-10\%)$) may be an unprecedented discriminator of nuclear equations of state in neutron stars. In addition, we find the multi-band and multi-messenger observations of this binary will be sensitive to alternative theories of gravity and beyond standard models, e.g., dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and axion field that is coupled to matter.",astro-ph.HE

We systematically investigate some possible astrophysical processes that may cause RM variations of an FRB repeater. The processes include (1) a supernova remnant (SNR) with a fluctuating medium; (2) a binary system with stellar winds from a massive/giant star companion or stellar flares from a low-mass star companion; (3) a pair plasma medium from a neutron star (including pulsar winds, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar flares); (4) outflows from a massive black hole. For the SNR scenario, a large relative RM variation within a few years requires that the SNR is young with a thin and local anisotropic shell, or the size of dense gas clouds in interstellar/circumstellar medium around the SNR is extremely small. If the RM variation is caused by the companion medium in a binary system, it is more likely from the stellar winds of a massive/giant star companion. The RM variation contributed by stellar flares from a low-mass star is disfavored, because this scenario predicts an extremely large relative RM variation during a short period of time. The scenarios invoking a pair plasma from a neutron star can be ruled out due to their extremely low RM contributions. Outflows from a massive black hole could provide a large RM variation if the FRB source is in the vicinity of the black hole.",astro-ph.HE

Strongly lensed FRBs are expected to be found as well, which can provide precise time delays and thus have rich applications in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, the radio signal of lensed FRBs will be deflected by plasma in lens galaxies in addition to gravity. Such deflections by both gravity and plasma will cause frequency dependent time delays, which are different from the dispersion delay and the geometric delay caused by gravitational lensing. Depending on the lensing and plasma models, the frequency-time delay relation of the lensed images can show distinguishing behaviours either between the multiple images, or from the dispersion relation. Such phenomena cannot be neglected in future studies, especially at low radio frequency, as plasma exists in lens galaxies in general. More importantly, such information provides not only a potential way to search for lensed FRBs, but also constraints on the mass and plasma distributions in lens galaxy. In particular, plasma may make the missing central images observable at low radio frequency.",astro-ph.HE

We present a method of reconstructing all-sky information of the Galactic magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight, $B_{\parallel}$, using simulated observations of the RM and DM along lines of sight to radio galaxies and FRB populations, respectively. This technique is capable of distinguishing between different input Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density models. Significant extragalactic contributions to the DM are the predominant impediment in accurately reconstructing the Galactic DM and $\left<B_{\parallel}\right>$ skies. We look at ways to improve the reconstruction by applying a filtering algorithm on the simulated DM lines of sight and we derive generalized corrections for DM observations at $|b|$ > 10 deg that help to disentangle Galactic and extragalactic DM contributions. Overall, we are able to reconstruct both large-scale Galactic structure and local features in the Milky Way's magnetic field from the assumed models. We discuss the application of this technique to future FRB observations and address possible differences between our simulated model and observed data, namely: adjusting the priors of the inference model, an unevenly distributed population of FRBs on the sky, and localized extragalactic DM structures.",astro-ph.GA

Wave passage through a turbulent medium affects gravitational image magnification, lensing probability (particularly for strong magnification events), and the time delay between images. The magnification is suppressed because of the broadening of the angular size of the source due to scattering by the plasma. The time delay between images is modified as the result of different dispersion measure (DM) along photon trajectories for different images. Each of the image lightcurve is also broadened due to wave scattering so that the images could have distinct temporal profiles. The first two effects are most severe for stellar and sub-stellar mass lens, and the last one (scatter broadening) for lenses and plasma screens at cosmological distances from the source/observer. This could limit the use of FRBs to measure their cosmic abundance. On the other hand, when the time delay between images is large, such that the lightcurve of a transient source has two or more well separated peaks, the different DMs along the wave paths of different images can probe density fluctuations in the IGM on scales $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ rad and explore the patchy reionization history of the universe using lensed FRBs at high redshifts.

Using an updated sample of 16 ASKAP FRBs detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) Survey and localised to their host galaxies, and 60 unlocalised FRBs from Parkes and ASKAP, our best-fitting value of H$_0$ is calculated to be $73_{-8}^{+12}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Uncertainties in FRB energetics and DM$_{\rm host}$ produce larger uncertainties in the inferred value of H$_0$ compared to previous FRB-based estimates. Using a prior on H$_0$ covering the 67--74 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ range, we estimate a median DM$_{\rm host} = 186_{-48}^{+59}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, exceeding previous estimates.

In this work, we present the highest-frequency detections of bursts from this FRB, using the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope at 4$-$8 GHz. We present the results from two observing campaigns. We performed the first campaign over an entire activity period which resulted in no detections. The second campaign was in an active window at 4$-$8 GHz which we predicted from our modelling of chromaticity, resulting in eight burst detections. The bursts were detected in a window of 1.35 days, 3.6 days preceding the activity peak seen by CHIME, suggesting the chromaticity extends to higher frequency. The detected bursts have narrower temporal widths and larger spectral widths compared to lower frequencies. All of them have flat polarization position angle sweeps and high polarization fractions. The bursts also exhibit diffractive scintillation due to the Milky Way, following a $f^{3.90\pm0.05}$ scaling, and vary significantly over time. We find that burst rate across frequency scales as $f^{-2.6\pm0.2}$. Lastly, we examine implications of the frequency dependency on the source models.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2207.13489,"Kai Liao, Marek Biesiada, Zong-Hong Zhu, ",Strongly Lensed Transient Sources: A Review,"The past decades have witnessed a lot of progress in gravitational lensing with two main targets: stars and galaxies (with active galactic nuclei). The success is partially attributed to the continuous luminescence of these sources making the detection and monitoring relatively easy. With the running of ongoing and upcoming large facilities/surveys in various electromagnetic and gravitational-wave bands, the era of time-domain surveys would guarantee constant detection of strongly lensed explosive transient events, for example, supernovae in all types, gamma ray bursts with afterglows in all bands, fast radio bursts and even gravitational waves. Lensed transients have many advantages over the traditional targets in studying the Universe and magnification effect helps to understand the transients themselves at high redshifts. In this review article, basing on the recent achievements in the literature, we summarize the methods of searching for different kinds of lensed transient signals, the latest results on detection and their applications in fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology. At the same time, we give supplementary comments as well as prospects of this emerging research direction that may help readers who are interested in entering this field.",astro-ph.HE

Kuhn et al.,Antenna characterization for the HIRAX experiment,"The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) aims to improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state through measurements of large-scale structure at high redshift ($0.8<z<2.5$), while serving as a state-of-the-art fast radio burst detector. Bright galactic foregrounds contaminate the 400--800~MHz HIRAX frequency band, so meeting the science goals will require precise instrument characterization. In this paper we describe characterization of the HIRAX antenna, focusing on measurements of the antenna beam and antenna noise temperature.   Beam measurements of the current HIRAX antenna design were performed in an anechoic chamber and compared to simulations. We report measurement techniques and results, which find a broad and symmetric antenna beam for $\nu <$650MHz, and elevated cross-polarization levels and beam asymmetries for $\nu >$700MHz. Noise temperature measurements of the HIRAX feeds were performed in a custom apparatus built at Yale. In this system, identical loads, one cryogenic and the other at room temperature, are used to take a differential (Y-factor) measurement from which the noise of the system is inferred. Several measurement sets have been conducted using the system, involving CHIME feeds as well as four of the HIRAX active feeds. These measurements give the first noise temperature measurements of the HIRAX feed, revealing a $\sim$60K noise temperature (relative to 30K target) with 40K peak- to-peak frequency-dependent features, and provide the first demonstration of feed repeatability. Both findings inform current and future feed designs.",astro-ph.IM

We searched dispersion measures (DMs) ranging between 0 to 5000 pc cm$^{-3}$ with the HEIMDALL and FETCH detection and classification algorithms. All four of the FRBs discovered have significantly larger widths ($> 50$ ms) than almost all of the FRBs detected and cataloged to date. The large pulse widths are not dominated by interstellar scattering or dispersive smearing within channels. One of the FRBs has a DM of 3338 pc cm$^{3}$, the largest measured for any FRB to date. These are also the first FRBs detected by any radio telescope so far, predating the Lorimer Burst by almost a decade. Our results suggest that pulsar survey archives remain important sources of previously undetected FRBs and that searches for FRBs on time scales extending beyond $\sim 100$ ms may reveal the presence of a larger population of wide-pulse FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Our approach uses the statistical advantages of $N$-body simulations, while painting on the profile of gas around individual halos in ways that can be motivated by semi-analytic models or zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies. Possible applications of the algorithm include extragalactic dispersion measures to fast radio bursts (FRBs), the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, baryonic effects on weak lensing, and cosmic metal enrichment. As an initial application, we use this tool to investigate how the baryonic profile of foreground galactic-mass halos affects the statistics of the dispersion measure (DM) towards cosmological FRBs.   We show that the distribution of DM is sensitive to the distribution of baryons in galactic halos, with viable gas profile models having significantly different probability distributions for DM to a given redshift. We also investigate the requirements to statistically measure the circumgalactic electron profile for FRB analyses that stack DM with impact parameter to foreground galaxies, quantifying the size of the contaminating ""two-halo"" term from correlated systems and the number of FRBs for a high significance detection.

arXiv:2207.04653,Joseph W. Kania et al.,Millisecond Cadence Radio Frequency Interference Filters,"Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) greatly reduces sensitivity of radio observations to astrophysical signals and creates false positive candidates in searches for radio transients. Real signals are missed while considerable computational and human resources are needed to remove RFI candidates. In the context of transient astrophysics, this makes effective RFI removal vital to effective searches for fast radio bursts and pulsars. Radio telescopes typically sample at rates that are high enough for there to be tens to hundreds of samples along the transient's pulse. Mitigation techniques should excise RFI on this timescale to account for a changing radio frequency environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of three filters, as well as a composite of the three, that excises RFI at the cadence that the data are recorded. Each of these filters operates in a different domain and thus excises as a different RFI morphology. We analyze the performance of these four filters in three different situations: (I) synthetic pulses in Gaussian noise; (II) synthetic pulses injected into real data; (III) four pulsar observations. From these tests, we gain insight into how the filters affect both the pulse and the noise level. This allows use to outline which and how the filters should be used based on the RFI present and the characteristics of the source signal. We show by flagging a small percentage of the spectrum we can substantially improve the quality of transit observations.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2207.04267,N. Lewandowska et al.,Single Pulse Dispersion Measure of the Crab Pulsar,"We investigate the use of bright single pulses from the Crab pulsar to determine separately the dispersion measure (DM) for the Main Pulse and Interpulse components. We develop two approaches using cross correlation functions (CCFs). The first method computes the CCF of the total intensity of each of 64 frequency channels with a reference channel and converts the time lag of maximum correlation into a DM. The second method separately computes the CCF between every pair of channels for each individual bright pulse and extracts an average DM from the distribution of all channel-pair DMs. Both methods allow the determination of the DM with a relative uncertainty of better than 10^-5 and provide robust estimates for the uncertainty of the best-fit value. We find differences in DM between the Main Pulse, the Low Frequency Interpulse, and the High Frequency Interpulse using both methods in a frequency range from 4 to 6 GHz. Earlier observations of the High Frequency Interpulse carried out by Hankins et al. (2016) resulted in DM_HFIP-DM_MP of 0.010 +- 0.016 pc cm^-3. Our results indicate a DM_HFIP-DM_MP of 0.0127 +- 0.0011 pc cm^-3 (with DM_comp being the DM value of the respective emission component), confirming earlier results with an independent method. During our studies we also find a relation between the brightness of single pulses in the High Frequency Interpulse and their DM. We also discuss the application of the developed methods on the identification of substructures in the case of Fast Radio Bursts.",astro-ph.SR

However, all these constraints have relied on using the first-order Taylor expansion of the dispersion due to a nonzero photon mass. In this work, we present an analysis of the nonzero photon mass dispersion with the second-order derivative of Taylor series. If the arrival time delay corrected for all known effects (including the first-order delay time due to the plasma and photon mass effects) is assumed to be dominated by the second-order term of the nonzero photon mass dispersion, a conservative upper limit on the photon mass can be estimated. Here we show that the dedispersed pulses with the second-order time delays from the Crab pulsar and the fast radio burst FRB 180916B pose strict limits on the photon mass, i.e., $m_{\gamma,2} \leq5.7\times10^{-46}\;{\rm kg}\simeq3.2\times10^{-10}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ and $m_{\gamma,2} \leq6.0\times10^{-47}\;{\rm kg}\simeq3.4\times10^{-11}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$, respectively.

arXiv:2206.14310,"Liam Connor, Vikram Ravi, ",Stellar prospects for FRB gravitational lensing,"Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) offers an exciting avenue for several cosmological applications. However, it is not yet clear how many such events future surveys will detect nor how to optimally find them. We use the known properties of FRBs to forecast detection rates of gravitational lensing on delay timescales from microseconds to years, corresponding to lens masses spanning fifteen orders of magnitude. We highlight the role of the FRB redshift distribution on our ability to observe gravitational lensing. We consider cosmological lensing of FRBs by stars in foreground galaxies and show that strong stellar lensing will dominate on microsecond timescales. Upcoming surveys such as DSA-2000 and CHORD will constrain the fraction of dark matter in compact objects (e.g. primordial black holes) and may detect millilensing events from intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or small dark matter halos. Coherent all-sky monitors will be able to detect longer-duration lensing events from massive galaxies, in addition to short time-scale lensing. Finally, we propose a new application of FRB gravitational lensing that will measure directly the circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2206.14079,Marcus Merryfield et al.,An Injection System for the CHIME/FRB Experiment,"Dedicated surveys searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are subject to selection effects which bias the observed population of events. Software injection systems are one method of correcting for these biases by injecting a mock population of synthetic FRBs directly into the realtime search pipeline. The injected population may then be used to map intrinsic burst properties onto an expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), so long as telescope characteristics such as the beam model and calibration factors are properly accounted for. This paper presents an injection system developed for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB). The system was tested to ensure high detection efficiency, and the pulse calibration method was verified. Using an injection population of ~85,000 synthetic FRBs, we found that the correlation between fluence and SNR for injected FRBs was consistent with that of CHIME/FRB detections in the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We also noted that the sensitivity of the telescope varied strongly as a function of the broadened burst width, but not as a function of the dispersion measure. We conclude that some of the machine-learning based Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) mitigation methods used by CHIME/FRB can be re-trained using injection data to increase sensitivity to wide events, and that planned upgrades to the presented injection system will allow for determining a more accurate CHIME/FRB selection function in the near future.",astro-ph.IM

Using the Anderson--Darling test, we compared the distributions of extra-Galactic dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm E}$) of non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs and all FRBs. It was found that the $ DM_{\rm E}$ values of three sub-samples are log-normally distributed. The $DM_{\rm E}$ of repeaters and non-repeaters were drawn from a different distribution on basis of the Mann--Whitney--Wilcoxon test. In addition, assuming that the non-repeating FRBs identified currently may be potentially repeators, i.e., the repeating FRBs to be universal and representative, one can utilize the averaged fluence of repeating FRBs as an indication from which to derive an apparent intensity distribution function (IDF) with a power-law index of $a_1=$ $1.10\pm 0.14$ ($a_2=$ $1.01\pm 0.16$, the observed fluence as a statistical variant), which is in good agreement with the previous IDF of 16 non-repeating FRBs found by Li et al. Based on the above statistics of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, we propose that both types of FRBs may have different cosmological origins, spatial distributions and circum-burst environments. Interestingly, the differential luminosity distributions of repeating and non-repeating FRBs can also be well described by a broken power-law function with the same power-law index of $-$1.4.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2206.13534,"Huangyu Xiao, Liang Dai, Matthew McQuinn, ",Detecting Cosmic Strings with Lensed Fast Radio Bursts,"Correlated red noise recently reported from pulsar timing observations may be an indication of stochastic gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings that formed during a primordial phase transition near the Grand Unification energy scale. Unfortunately, known probes of cosmic strings, namely the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies and string lensing of extragalactic galaxies, are not sensitive enough for low string tensions of $G\mu = 10^{-10}-10^{-7}$ that are needed to explain this putative signal. We show that strong gravitational lensing of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by cosmic strings is a potentially unambiguous avenue to probe that range of string tension values. The image pair of string lensing are expected to have identical magnification factor and parity, and have a typical time delay of $\sim 10^2\,\,(G\,\mu/10^{-8})^2$ seconds. The unique spectral fingerprint of each FRB, as well as the possibility to detect correlations in the time series of the electric field of the radio waves, will enable verification of the string lensing interpretation. Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations can spatially resolve the image pair and provide a lower bound on the string tension based on the image separation. We calculate the FRB lensing rate as a function of FRB detection number for several different models of the FRB redshift distribution. We find that a survey detecting $\sim 10^5$ FRBs, in line with estimates for the detection rate of the forthcoming survey CHORD, can uncover a strong lensing event for a string tension of $G\mu \simeq 10^{-7}$. Larger FRB surveys, such as Phase 2 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), have the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity on the string tension to $G\mu \simeq 10^{-9}$.",astro-ph.CO

VT 1137-0337 is located in the brightest region of a dwarf starburst galaxy (stellar mass $\sim 10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$, star formation rate $\sim 0.5 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) at a luminosity distance of 121.6 Mpc. Its 3 GHz luminosity of $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ is comparable to luminous radio supernovae associated with dense circumstellar interaction and relativistic outflows. However, its broadband radio spectrum - a featureless power law $\propto \nu^{-0.35 \pm 0.02}$ over a range of $\gtrsim$10$\times$ in frequency and fading at a rate of $\sim$ 5% per year over 4 years - cannot be directly explained by the shock of a stellar explosion. Jets launched by various classes of accreting black holes also struggle to account for VT 1137-0337's combination of observational properties. Instead, we propose that VT 1137-0337 is a $\sim$decades old pulsar wind nebula that has recently emerged from within the free-free opacity of its surrounding supernova ejecta. If the nebula is powered by spindown, the central neutron star should be highly magnetized, with a surface dipole field of $\sim 10^{13} - 10^{14}$ G and a present-day spin period of $\sim 10 - 100$ ms. Alternatively, the nebula may be powered by the release of magnetic energy from a magnetar. Magnetar nebulae have been proposed to explain the persistent radio sources associated with the repeating fast radio bursts FRB 121102 and FRB 190520B. These FRB persistent sources have not previously been observed as transients, but do bear a striking resemblance to VT 1137-0337 in their radio luminosity, spectral index, and host galaxy properties.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2206.11330,Seong Jin Kim et al.,On the relation between duration and energy of non-repeating fast radio bursts: census with the CHIME data,"A correlation between the intrinsic energy and the burst duration of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been reported. If it exists, the correlation can be used to estimate intrinsic energy from the duration, and thus can provide us with a new distance measure for cosmology. However, the correlation suffered from small number statistics (68 FRBs) and was not free from contamination by latent repeating populations, which might not have such a correlation. How to separate/exclude the repeating bursts from the mixture of all different types of FRBs is essential to see this property. Using a much larger sample from the new FRB catalogue (containing 536 FRBs) recently released by the CHIME/FRB project, combined with a new classification method developed based on unsupervised machine learning, we carried out further scrutiny of the relation. We found that there is a weak correlation between the intrinsic energy and duration for non-repeating FRBs at z < 0.3 with Kendall's tau correlation coefficient of 0.239 and significance of 0.001 (statistically significant), whose slope looks similar to that of gamma-ray bursts. This correlation becomes weaker and insignificant at higher redshifts (z > 0.3), possibly due to the lack of the faint FRBs at high-z and/or the redshift evolution of the correlation. The scattering time in the CHIME/FRB catalogue shows an intriguing trend: it varies along the line obtained from linear fit on the energy versus duration plane between these two parameters. A possible cosmological application of the relation must wait for faint FRBs at high-z.",astro-ph.CO

The highly super-Eddington accretion rates achieved during this brief phase ($\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{5}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd})$ are accompanied by intense mass-loss in disk winds, analogous but even more extreme than ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources in the nearby universe. Also in analogy with observed ULX, this expanding outflow will inflate an energetic `bubble' of plasma into the circumbinary medium. Embedded within this bubble is a nebula of relativistic electrons heated at the termination shock of the faster $v \gtrsim 0.1 c$ wind/jet from the inner accretion flow. We present a time-dependent, one-zone model for the synchrotron radio emission and other observable properties of such ULX `hyper-nebulae'. If ULX jets are sources of repeating fast radio bursts (FRB), as recently proposed, such hyper-nebulae could generate persistent radio emission and contribute large and time-variable rotation measure to the bursts, consistent with those seen from FRB 20121102 and FRB 190520B. ULX hyper-nebulae can be discovered independent of an FRB association in radio surveys such as VLASS, as off-nuclear point-sources whose fluxes can evolve significantly on timescales as short as years, possibly presaging energetic transients from common envelope mergers.",astro-ph.HE

The occurrence rate of quasi-periodic micro-structure is consistent among pulses with different peak flux densities. Using an auto-correlation analysis, we measure the periodicity and width of the micro-structure in these three pulsars. The detected micro-structure from PSRs J1022+1001 and J1744-1134 is often highly linearly polarised. In PSR J1022+1001, the linear polarisation position angles of micro-structure pulses are in general flat with a small degree of variation. Using these results, we further examine the frequency and rotational period dependency of micro-structure properties established in previous work, along with the angular beaming and temporal modulation models that explains the appearance of micro-structure. We also discuss a possible link of micro-structure to the properties of some of the recently discovered fast radio bursts which exhibit a very similar emission morphology.",astro-ph.HE

The FRB radio-emission physics and the compact objects involved in these events are subjects of intense active debate. To better constrain source models, the Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is optimized to discover and localize a large sample of rare, high-fluence, nearby FRBs. This is the population most amenable to multi-messenger, multi-wavelength follow-up, allowing deeper understanding of source mechanisms. BURSTT will provide horizon-to-horizon sky coverage with a half power field-of-view (FoV) of $\sim$10$^{4}$ deg$^{2}$, a 400 MHz effective bandwidth between 300-800 MHz, and sub-arcsecond localization, made possible using outrigger stations hundreds to thousands of km from the main array. Initially, BURSTT will employ 256 antennas. After tests of various antenna designs and optimization of system performance we plan to expand to 2048 antennas. We estimate that BURSTT-256 will detect and localize $\sim$100 bright ($\geq$100 Jy ms) FRBs per year. Another advantage of BURSTT's large FoV and continuous operation will be greatly enhanced monitoring of FRBs for repetition.

FRBs are highly energetic ($\sim 10^{36}$-$10^{42}$ ergs) flashes that last for about a millisecond. Thanks to its broad bandwidth (400-800 MHz), large field of view ($\sim$200 sq. deg.), and massive data rate (1500 TB of coherently beamformed data per day), the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment / Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project has increased the total number of discovered FRBs by over a factor 10 in 3 years of operation.

In this work, we describe our novel technique for mitigating RFI in CHIME/FRB real-time intensity data. We mitigate RFI through a sequence of iterative operations, which mask out statistical outliers from frequency-channelized intensity data that have been effectively high-pass filtered.

In this paper, we attempted to use the DM-z relationship of FRBs to study the helium abundance ($Y_{\rm He}$) in the universe. First, we used 17 current FRBs with known redshifts for our study. Due to their low redshifts and the strong degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$ and $\Omega_bh^2$, however, this catalog could not provide a good constraint on the helium abundance. Then, we simulated 500 low redshift FRB mock data with $z\in[0,\,1.5]$ to forecast the constraining ability on $Y_{\rm He}$. In order to break the degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ further, we introduced the shift parameters of the Planck measurement $(R,l_A,\Omega_bh^2)$ as a prior, where $\Omega_bh^2$ represents the baryon density parameter, and $R$ and $l_A$ correspond to the scaled distance to recombination and the angular scale of the sound horizon at recombination, respectively. We obtained the standard deviation for the helium abundance: $\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.025$. Finally, we considered 2000 higher redshift FRB data with the redshift distribution of $[0,\,3]$ and found that the constraining power for $Y_{\rm He}$ would be improved by more than 2 times, $\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.011$, which indicates that the FRB data with high redshift can provide a better constraint on the helium abundance. Hopefully, large FRB samples with high redshift from the Square Kilometre Array can provide high-precision measurements of the helium abundance in the near future.",astro-ph.CO

Here we report $60$ bursts detected with the Effelsberg telescope at 1.4 GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E `burst storm', where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence $\geq 0.04$ Jy ms) occurred within only 40 minutes. We find no strict periodicity in the burst arrival times, nor any evidence for periodicity in the source's activity between observations. The burst storm shows a steep energy distribution (power-law index $\alpha = 2.39\pm0.12$) and a bi-modal wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ s and 23.61$^{+3.06}_{-2.71}$ s. We attribute these wait-time distribution peaks to a characteristic event timescale and pseudo-Poisson burst rate, respectively. The secondary wait-time peak at $\sim1$ s is $\sim50\times$ longer than the $\sim24$ ms timescale seen for both FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A -- potentially indicating a larger emission region, or slower burst propagation. FRB 20200120E shows order-of-magnitude lower burst durations and luminosities compared with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A. Lastly, in contrast to FRB 20121102A, which has observed dispersion measure (DM) variations of $\Delta{\rm DM} >1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ on month-to-year timescales, we determine that FRB 20200120E's DM has remained stable ($\Delta{\rm DM} <0.15$ pc cm$^{-3}$) over $>10$ months.

arXiv:2206.01346,Manisha Caleb et al.,Discovery of a radio emitting neutron star with an ultra-long spin period of 76 seconds,"The radio-emitting neutron star population encompasses objects with spin periods ranging from milliseconds to tens of seconds. As they age and spin more slowly, their radio emission is expected to cease. We present the discovery of an ultra-long period radio-emitting neutron star, J0901-4046, with spin properties distinct from the known spin and magnetic-decay powered neutron stars. With a spin-period of 75.88 s, a characteristic age of 5.3 Myr, and a narrow pulse duty-cycle, it is uncertain how radio emission is generated and challenges our current understanding of how these systems evolve. The radio emission has unique spectro-temporal properties such as quasi-periodicity and partial nulling that provide important clues to the emission mechanism. Detecting similar sources is observationally challenging, which implies a larger undetected population. Our discovery establishes the existence of ultra-long period neutron stars, suggesting a possible connection to the evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars, ultra-long period magnetars, and fast radio bursts",astro-ph.HE

Our hybrid approach combines a coherent search with an average field-of-view of 0.4 $\rm deg^{2}$ with an incoherent search utilizing a field-of-view of $\sim$1.27 $\rm deg^{2}$ (both at 1284~MHz). Here, we present results on the first three FRBs: FRB 20200413A (DM=1990.05 pc cm$^{-3}$), FRB 20200915A (DM=740.65 pc cm$^{-3}$), and FRB 20201123A (DM=433.55 pc cm$^{-3}$). FRB 20200413A was discovered only in the incoherent beam. FRB 20200915A (also discovered only in the incoherent beam) shows speckled emission in the dynamic spectrum which cannot be explained by interstellar scintillation in our Galaxy or plasma lensing, and might be intrinsic to the source. FRB 20201123A shows a faint post-cursor burst about 200 ms after the main burst and warrants further follow-up to confirm whether it is a repeating FRB. FRB 20201123A also exhibits significant temporal broadening consistent with scattering by a turbulent medium. The broadening exceeds that predicted for medium along the sightline through our Galaxy. We associate this scattering with the turbulent medium in the environment of the FRB in the host galaxy. Within the approximately $1'$ localization region of FRB 20201123A, we identify one luminous galaxy ($r \approx 15.67$; J173438.35$-$504550.4) that dominates the posterior probability for a host association. The galaxy's measured properties are consistent with other FRB hosts with secure associations.",astro-ph.HE

Pair plasmas in magnetic field is birefringent, a $\propto B^2$ effect. As a result, such plasmas work as phase retarders: Stokes parameters follow a circular trajectory on the Poincare sphere. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega, \, \omega_p \ll \omega_B$, the corresponding rotation rates are independent of the magnetic field. A plasma screen with dispersion measure DM $\sim 10^{-6}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ can induce large polarization changes, including large effective Rotation Measure (RM). The frequency scaling of the (generalized) RM, $ \propto \lambda ^\alpha $, mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha =2$ for small phase shifts, but can be as small as $\alpha =1$. In interpreting observations the frequency scaling of polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers explanations for (i) large circular polarization component observed in FRBs, with right-left switching; (ii) large RM, with possible sign changes; (iii) time-depend variable polarization. Relatively dense and slow wind is needed - the corresponding effect in regular pulsars is small.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2205.12716,M. HÃ¼bner et al.,Searching for quasi-periodic oscillations in astrophysical transients using Gaussian processes,"Analyses of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are important to understanding the dynamic behaviour in many astrophysical objects during transient events like gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, magnetar flares and fast radio bursts. Astrophysicists often search for QPOs with frequency-domain methods such as (Lomb-Scargle) periodograms, which generally assume power-law models plus some excess around the QPO frequency. Time-series data can alternatively be investigated directly in the time domain using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. While GP regression is computationally expensive in the general case, the properties of astrophysical data and models allow fast likelihood strategies. Heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity in data have been shown to cause bias in periodogram-based analyses. Gaussian processes can take account of these properties. Using GPs, we model QPOs as a stochastic process on top of a deterministic flare shape. Using Bayesian inference, we demonstrate how to infer GP hyperparameters and assign them physical meaning, such as the QPO frequency. We also perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models such as red noise and show that this can be used to reliably find QPOs. This method is easily applicable to a variety of different astrophysical data sets. We demonstrate the use of this method on a range of short transients: a gamma-ray burst, a magnetar flare, a magnetar giant flare, and simulated solar flare data.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2205.12362,Joeri van Leeuwen et al.,"The Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS): Design, Commissioning, Data Release, and Detection of the first 5 Fast Radio Bursts","Fast Radio Bursts must be powered by uniquely energetic emission mechanisms. This requirement has eliminated a number of possible source types, but several remain. Identifying the physical nature of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) emitters arguably requires good localisation of more detections, and broadband studies enabled by real-time alerting. We here present the Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS), a supercomputing radio-telescope instrument that performs real-time FRB detection and localisation on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) interferometer. It reaches coherent-addition sensitivity over the entire field of the view of the primary dish beam. After commissioning results verified the system performed as planned, we initiated the Apertif FRB survey (ALERT). Over the first 5 weeks we observed at design sensitivity in 2019, we detected 5 new FRBs, and interferometrically localised each of these to 0.4--10 sq. arcmin. All detections are broad band and very narrow, of order 1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally high. Only through the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these hard-to-find FRBs detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic population properties. Most localisation regions are small enough to rule out the presence of associated persistent radio sources. Three FRBs cut through the halos of M31 and M33. We demonstrate that Apertif can localise one-off FRBs with an accuracy that maps magneto-ionic material along well-defined lines of sight. The rate of 1 every ~7 days next ensures a considerable number of new sources are detected for such study. The combination of detection rate and localisation accuracy exemplified by the 5 first ARTS FRBs thus marks a new phase in which a growing number of bursts can be used to probe our Universe.",astro-ph.HE

Some 20 arcsec from the centre of this nearby spiral galaxy, we discovered a bright and compact radio source, J054149.24-641813.7, of unknown origin. To constrain the nature of J054149.24-641813.7, we searched for transient events with the Ultra-Wideband Low Parkes receiver, and compare its luminosity and spectral index to various nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), and fast radio burst (FRB) local environments. Its radio spectral index is flat (${\alpha} = 0.02 \pm 0.09$) which is unlikely to be either an SNR or pulsar. No transient events were detected with the Parkes telescope over three days of observations, and our calculations show J054149.24-641813.7 is two orders of magnitude less luminous than the persistent radio sources associated with FRB 121102 & 190520B. We find that the probability of finding such a source behind NGC 2082 is P = 1.2%, and conclude that the most likely origin for J054149.24-641813.7 is a background quasar or radio galaxy.",astro-ph.GA

It is as of yet unclear what proposed mechanism produces the activity, but polarization information is a key diagnostic. Here, we report on the polarization properties of 44 bursts from FRB 20180916B detected between 2018 December and 2021 December by CHIME/FRB, the FRB project on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. In contrast to previous observations, we find significant variations in the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of FRB 20180916B. Over the nine month period 2021 April$-$2021 December we observe an apparent secular increase in $\rm{RM}$ of $\sim 50 \; \rm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ (a fractional change of over $40\%$) that is accompanied by a possible drift of the emitting band to lower frequencies. This interval displays very little variation in the dispersion measure ($\Delta \rm{DM}\lesssim 0.8\; \rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$) which indicates that the observed RM evolution is likely produced from coherent changes in the Faraday-active medium's magnetic field. Burst-to-burst RM variations appear unrelated to the activity cycle phase. The degree of linear polarization of our burst sample ($\gtrsim 80\%$) is consistent with the negligible depolarization expected for this source in the 400-800 MHz bandpass of CHIME. FRB 20180916B joins other repeating FRBs in displaying substantial RM variations between bursts. This is consistent with the notion that repeater progenitors may be associated with young stellar populations by their preferential occupation of dynamic magnetized environments commonly found in supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae or near high mass stellar companions.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2205.07926,Thais Lemos et al.,Cosmological model-independent constraints on the baryon fraction in the IGM from fast radio bursts and supernovae data,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients with an observed dispersion measure ($DM$) greater than the expected Milky Way contribution, which suggests that such events are of extragalactic origin. Although some models have been proposed to explain the physics of the pulse, the mechanism behind the FRBs emission is still unknown. From FRBs data with known host galaxies, the redshift is directly measured and can be combined with estimates of the $DM$ to constrain the cosmological parameters, such as the baryon number density and the Hubble constant. However, the poor knowledge of the fraction of baryonic mass in the intergalactic medium ($f_{IGM}$) and its degeneracy with the cosmological parameters impose limits on the cosmological application of FRBs. In this work we present a cosmological model-independent method to determine the evolution of $f_{IGM}$ combining the latest FRBs observations with localized host galaxy and current supernovae data. We consider constant and time-dependent $f_{IGM}$ parameterizations and show, through a Bayesian model selection analysis, that a conclusive answer about the time-evolution of $f_{IGM}$ depend strongly on the $DM$ fluctuations due to the spatial variation in cosmic electron density ($\delta$). In particular, our analysis show that the evidence varies from strong (in favor of a growing evolution of $f_{IGM}$ with redshift) to inconclusive, as larger values of $\delta$ are considered.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2205.07917,Dongzi Li et al.,A Highly Variable Magnetized Environment in a Pulsar Binary resembling Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short, intense extragalactic radio bursts of unknown origin. Recent polarimetric studies have shown that a noticeable fraction of the repeating FRBs display irregular, short-time variations of the Faraday rotation measure (RM). Moreover, evidence for rare propagation effects such as Faraday conversion and polarized attenuation is seen in at least one FRB repeater. Together, they suggest a highly variable magneto-active circum-burst environment. In this paper, we report similar behavior in a globular cluster pulsar binary system PSR B1744-24A. We observe irregular fast changes of RM with both signs at random orbital phases as well as profile changes of the circular polarization when the pulsar emission passes close to the companion. The latter provides strong evidence for Faraday conversion and circularly polarized attenuation. These similarities between PSR B1744-24A and some FRB repeaters, as well as the possible binary-produced long-term periodicity of two active repeaters, and the discovery of a nearby FRB in a globular cluster, where pulsar binaries are common, all suggest that some fraction of FRBs have binary companions.",astro-ph.HE

Zhang et al.,A hyper flare of a weeks-old magnetar born from a binary-neutron-star merger,"Magnetars, a population of isolated neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields of $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G, have been increasingly accepted to explain a variety of astrophysical transients. A nascent millisecond-period magnetar can release its spin-down energy and power bright sources such as Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and their subsequent X-ray plateaus, Super Luminous Supernovae (SLSNe), and the fast X-ray transients such as CDF-S XT-2. Magnetars with ages of $10^3-10^4$ years have been observed within the Milky Way Galaxy, which are found to power diverse transients with the expense of their magnetic energy, in the form of giant flares and repeated soft-$\gamma$-ray or hard X-ray bursts and occasionally fast radio bursts (FRBs). Magnetar giant flares were also detected as disguised short GRBs from nearby galaxies . Here we report the identification of a GRB as a hyper flare of magnetar in a nearby galaxy. The magnitude of the hyper flare is about one thousand times brighter than that of a typical magnetar giant flare. A significant $\sim 80$ millisecond period is detected in the decaying light curve. Interpreting this period as the rotation period and given a magnetic field strength typical for a young magnetar, the age of the magnetar is constrained to be only a few weeks. The non-detection of a (superluminous) supernova nor a GRB weeks before the event further constrains that the magnetar is likely born from an off-axis merger event of two neutron stars. Our finding bridges the gap between the hypothetical millisecond magnetars and the observed Galactic magnetars, and points toward a broader channel of magnetar-powered gamma-ray transients.",astro-ph.HE

For the first time, a radio burst with properties similar to those of fast radio bursts and with a X-ray counterpart was observed from this source, showing that magnetars can power at least a group of fast radio bursts. In this paper, we report on the X-ray spectral and timing properties of SGR J1935+2154 based on a long-term monitoring campaign with Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Swift and NICER covering a time span of ~7 months since the outburst onset. The broadband spectrum exhibited a non-thermal power-law component (photon index~1.2) extending up to ~20-25 keV throughout the campaign and a blackbody component with temperature decreasing from ~1.5 keV at the outburst peak to ~0.45 keV in the following months. We found that the luminosity decay is well described by the sum of two exponential functions, reflecting the fast decay (~1 d) at the early stage of the outburst followed by a slower decrease (~30 d). The source reached quiescence about ~80 days after the outburst onset, releasing an energy of ~6e40 erg during the outburst. We detected X-ray pulsations in the XMM-Newton data sets and derived an average spin-down rate of ~3.5e-11 s/s using the spin period measurements derived in this work and three values reported previously during the same active period. Moreover, we report on simultaneous radio observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope. No evidence for periodic or single-pulse radio emission was found.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2204.13489,"Maxim V. Barkov, Sergei B. Popov, ",Formation of periodic FRB in binary systems with eccentricity,"Long-term periodicity in the rate of flares is observed for two repeating sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this paper We present a hydrodynamical modeling of a massive binary consisting of a magnetar and an early-type star. We model the interaction of the pulsar wind from the magnetar with an intense stellar wind. It is shown that only during a fraction of the orbital period radio emission can escape the system. This explains the duty cycle of the two repeating FRB sources with periodic activity. The width of the transparency window depends on the eccentricity, stellar wind properties, and the viewing angle. To describe properties of the known sources it is necessary to assume large eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.5$. We apply the maser cyclotron mechanism of the radio emission generation to model spectral properties of the sources. The produced spectrum is not wide: $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$ and the typical frequency depends on the radius of the shock where the emission is generated. The shock radius changes along the orbit. This, together with changing parameters of the medium, allows us to explain the frequency drift during the phase of visibility. Frequency dependence of the degree of polarization at few GHz can be a consequence of a small scale turbulence in the shocked stellar wind. It is much more difficult to explain huge ($\sim 10^5$ [rad/m$^2$]) and variable value of the rotation measure observed for FRB 121102. We suggest that this can be explained if the supernova explosion which produced the magnetar happened near a dense interstellar cloud with $n \sim100$ cm$^{-3}$.",astro-ph.HE

We succeeded in the simultaneous optical observations of 11 radio bursts that FAST detected. However, no corresponding optical emission was found. The optical fluence limits as deep as 0.068 Jy ms are obtained for the individual bursts (0.029 Jy ms on the stacked data) corrected for the dust extinction in the Milky Way. The fluence limit is deeper than those obtained in the previous simultaneous observations for an optical emission with a duration $\gtrsim 0.1$ ms. Although the current limits on radio--optical spectral energy distribution (SED) of FRBs are not constraining, we show that SED models based on observed SEDs of radio variable objects such as optically detected pulsars, and a part of parameter spaces of theoretical models in which FRB optical emission is produced by inverse-Compton scattering in a pulsar magnetosphere or a strike of a magnetar blastwave into a hot wind bubble, can be ruled out once a similar fluence limit as in our observation is obtained for a bright FRB with a radio fluence $\gtrsim 5$ Jy ms.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2204.11663,"Almog Yalinewich, Ue-Li Pen, ",The Moving Mirror model for Fast Radio Bursts,"Recent observations of coherent radiation from the Crab pulsar (Bij et al 2021) suggest the emission is driven by an ultra - relativistic ($\gamma \sim 10^4$), cold plasma flow. A relativistically expanding plasma shell can compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium by $\gamma^2$. This mechanism has been studied in the past by Colgate and Noerdelinger (1971), in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this work we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin down energy of regular (or even recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics and absence of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of sub pulses decline with observation time as $\omega_{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to constrain the shape of the curve $\omega_{\rm obs} \left(t_{\rm obs} \right)$. Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant, the shock wave produces low frequency photons which are then Compton scattered to the GHz range.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2204.11648,Y-B. Wang et al.,The Multiple Images of the Plasma Lensing FRB,"We investigate the formation of multiple images as the radio signals from fast radio bursts (FRBs) pass through the plane of a plasma clump. The exponential model for the plasma clump is adopted to analyze the properties of the multiple images. By comparing with the classical dispersion relations, we find that one image has exhibited specific inverse properties to others, such as their delay times at high frequency is higher than that at low frequency, owing to the lensing effects of the plasma clump. We demonstrate that these inverse effects should be observable in some repeating FRBs. Our results predict deviation in the estimated DM across multiple images, consistent with the observations of FRB 121102 and FRB 180916.J0158+65. If other plasma lenses have effects similar to an exponential lens, we find that they should also give rise to the similar dispersion relation in the multiple images. For some repeating FRBs, analysis of the differences in time delay and in DM between multiple images at different frequencies can serve as a method to reveal the plasma distribution.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2204.10953,"Yuanhong Qu, Pawan Kumar, Bing Zhang, ",Transparency of Fast Radio Burst Waves in Magnetar Magnetospheres,"At least some fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by magnetars. Even though mounting observational evidence points towards a magnetospheric origin of FRB emission, the question of the location for FRB generation continues to be debated. One argument suggested against the magnetospheric origin of bright FRBs is that the radio waves associated with an FRB may lose most of their energy before escaping the magnetosphere because the cross-section for $e^\pm$ to scatter large-amplitude EM waves in the presence of a strong magnetic field is much larger than the Thompson cross-section. We have investigated this suggestion and find that FRB radiation traveling through the open field line region of a magnetar's magnetosphere does not suffer much loss due to two previously ignored factors. First, the plasma in the outer magnetosphere ($r \gta 10^9 \ $cm), where the losses are potentially most severe, is likely to be flowing outward at a high Lorentz factor $\gamma_p \geq 10^3$. Second, the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field vector, $\theta_B$, in the outer magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian or smaller due in part to the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that they get aligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the interaction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially. We find that a bright FRB with an isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm frb} \gta 10^{42} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ can escape the magnetosphere unscathed for a large section of the $\gamma_p-\theta_B$ parameter space, and therefore conclude that the generation of FRBs in magnetar magnetosphere passes this test.",astro-ph.HE

In cold electron-ion plasmas, the circular propagating wave modes primarily alter the linear polarization plane that scales with the inverse-square of the emission frequency. In relativistic plasmas, the wave modes are elliptically polarized, and it is possible to convert linearly polarized emission into circular and vice versa. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) enable the study of not only the electron-ion plasma of the intergalactic medium but potentially the extreme magneto-ionic medium in which these intense pulses are produced. Here we report on the polarimetric analysis of a repeat burst from the FRB 20201124A source. The burst displayed a significant frequency-dependent circularly polarized component, unlike other bursts from this source or any other FRB found to date. We model the frequency dependence of the circular polarization using a phenomenological generalized Faraday rotation framework.

We detected no additional bursts from these sources, nor did CHIME/FRB detect any additional bursts from these sources during our follow-up program. Based on these non-detections, we provide constraints on the repetition rate, for all nine sources. We calculate repetition rates above 1 Jy using both a Poisson distribution of repetition and the Weibull distribution of repetition presented by Oppermann et al. (2018). For both distributions, we find repetition upper limits of the order $\lambda = 10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \text{hr}^{-1}$ for all sources. These rates are much lower than those recently published for notable repeating FRBs like FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A, suggesting the possibility of a low-repetition sub-population.",astro-ph.HE

Recently, an X-ray burst from the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 was detected to be coincident with two fast radio burst (FRB) like events from the same source, providing evidence that FRBs may be linked to magnetar bursts. Using fully 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations, we show that such magnetar bursts may be produced by Alfv\'{e}n waves launched from localized magnetar quakes: a wave packet propagates to the outer magnetosphere, becomes nonlinear, and escapes the magnetosphere, forming an ultra-relativistic ejecta. The ejecta pushes open the magnetospheric field lines, creating current sheets behind it. Magnetic reconnection can happen at these current sheets, leading to plasma energization and X-ray emission. The angular size of the ejecta can be compact, $\lesssim 1$ sr if the quake launching region is small, $\lesssim 0.01$ sr at the stellar surface. We discuss implications for the FRBs and the coincident X-ray burst from SGR 1935+2154.",astro-ph.HE

The variations of Faraday rotation measure and dispersion measure, due to local environment, are crucial clues to understanding their physical nature. The recent observations on the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A show a significant variation on a day time scale. Intriguingly, the oscillation of rotation measure supports that the local contribution can change sign, which indicates the magnetic field reversal along the line of sight. Here we present a physical model that explains observed characteristics of FRB 20201124A and proposes that repeating signal comes from a binary system containing a magnetar and a Be star with a decretion disk. When the magnetar approaches the periastron, the propagation of radio waves through the disk of the Be star naturally leads to the observed varying rotation measure, depolarization, large scattering timescale, and Faraday conversion. This study will prompt to search for FRB signals from Be/X-ray binaries.",astro-ph.HE

With a novel dechannelization algorithm and a matched filtering technique, we search for repeated copies of the same electric field waveform in observations of FRBs detected by the FRB backend of the Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Intensity Experiment (CHIME). An interference fringe from a coherent gravitational lensing signal will appear in the time-lag domain as a statistically-significant peak in the time-lag autocorrelation function. We calibrate our statistical significance using telescope data containing no FRB signal. Our dataset consists of $\sim$100-ms long recordings of voltage data from 172 FRB events, dechannelized to 1.25-ns time resolution. This coherent search algorithm allows us to search for gravitational lensing signatures from compact objects in the mass range of $10^{-4}-10^{4} ~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. After ruling out an anomalous candidate due to diffractive scintillation, we find no significant detections of gravitational lensing in the 172 FRB events that have been analyzed. In a companion work [Leung, Kader+2022], we interpret the constraints on dark matter from this search.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2204.06001,Calvin Leung et al.,Constraining Primordial Black Holes using Fast Radio Burst Gravitational-Lens Interferometry with CHIME/FRB,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent an exciting frontier in the study of gravitational lensing, due to their brightness, extragalactic nature, and the compact, coherent characteristics of their emission. In a companion work [Kader, Leung+2022], we use a novel interferometric method to search for gravitationally lensed FRBs in the time domain using bursts detected by CHIME/FRB. There, we dechannelize and autocorrelate electric field data at a time resolution of 1.25 ns. This enables a search for FRBs whose emission is coherently deflected by gravitational lensing around a foreground compact object such as a primordial black hole (PBH). Here, we use our non-detection of lensed FRBs to place novel constraints on the PBH abundance outside the Local Group. We use a novel two-screen model to take into account decoherence from scattering screens in our constraints. Our constraints are subject to a single astrophysical model parameter -- the effective distance between an FRB source and the scattering screen, for which we adopt a fiducial distance of 1 parsec. We find that coherent FRB lensing is a sensitive probe of sub-solar mass compact objects. Having observed no lenses in $172$ bursts from $114$ independent sightlines through the cosmic web, we constrain the fraction of dark matter made of compact objects, such as PBHs, to be $f \lesssim 0.8$, if their masses are $\sim 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$.",astro-ph.HE

We present the current state of the instrument and the detection and characterisation of three bursts from FRB20180916B.

We detect no bursts from the other sources. We turn this result into a 95\% confidence level lower limit on the slope of the differential fluence distribution $\alpha$ to be $\alpha > 2.1$ and $\alpha > 2.2$ for FRB20181030A and FRB20200120E respectively.

We report a strong Quasi-Periodic Oscillation(QPO) of 40 Hz in the X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and associated with FRB 200428, significantly detected with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) and also hinted by the Konus-Wind data. QPOs from magnetar bursts have only been rarely detected; our 3.4 sigma (p-value is 2.9e-4) detection of the QPO reported here reveals the strongest QPO signal observed from magnetars (except in some very rare giant flares), making this X-ray burst unique among magnetar bursts. The two X-ray spikes coinciding with the two FRB pulses are also among the peaks of the QPO. Our results suggest that at least some FRBs are related to strong oscillation processes of neutron stars. We also show that we may overestimate the significance of the QPO signal and underestimate the errors of QPO parameters if QPO exists only in a fraction of the time series of a X-ray burst which we use to calculate the Leahy-normalized periodogram.",astro-ph.HE

SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most prolific bursters and the first confirmed source of fast radio burst (i.e. FRB 200428). Encouraged by the discovery of the first X-ray counterpart of FRB, Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) implemented a dedicated 33-day long ToO observation of SGR J1935+2154 since April 28, 2020. With the HE, ME, and LE telescopes, Insight-HXMT provides a thorough monitoring of burst activity evolution of SGR J1935+2154, in a very broad energy range (1-250 keV) with high temporal resolution and high sensitivity, resulting in a unique valuable data set for detailed studies of SGR J1935+2154. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of this observation including detailed burst search, identification and temporal analyses. After carefully removing false triggers, we find a total of 75 bursts from SGR J1935+2154, out of which 70 are single-pulsed. The maximum burst rate is about 56 bursts/day. Both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow log-normal distributions, consistent with previous studies. We also find that bursts with longer duration (some are multi-pulsed) tend to occur during the period with relatively high burst rate. There is no correlation between the waiting time and the fluence or duration of either the former or latter burst. It also seems that there is no correlation between burst duration and hardness ratio, in contrast to some previous reports. In addition, we do not find any X-ray burst associated with any reported radio bursts except for FRB 200428.",astro-ph.HE

Ocker et al.,Radio Scattering Horizons for Galactic and Extragalactic Transients,"Radio wave scattering can cause severe reductions in detection sensitivity for surveys of Galactic and extragalactic fast ($\sim$ms duration) transients. While Galactic sources like pulsars undergo scattering in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM), extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can also experience scattering in their host galaxies and other galaxies intervening their lines-of-sight. We assess Galactic and extragalactic scattering horizons for fast radio transients using a combination of NE2001 to model the dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) contributed by the Galactic disk, and independently constructed electron density models for the Galactic halo and other galaxies' ISMs and halos that account for different galaxy morphologies, masses, densities, and strengths of turbulence. For source redshifts $0.5\leq z_{\rm s}\leq1$, an all-sky, isotropic FRB population has simulated values of $\tau(1\rm~GHz)$ ranging from $\sim1~\mu$s to $\sim2$ ms ($90\%$ confidence, observer frame) that are dominated by host galaxies, although $\tau$ can be $\gg2$ ms at low Galactic latitudes. A population at $z_{\rm s}=5$ has $0.01\lesssim\tau\lesssim300$ ms at 1 GHz ($90\%$ confidence), dominated by intervening galaxies. About $20\%$ of these high-redshift FRBs are predicted to have $\tau>5$ ms at 1 GHz (observer frame), and $\gtrsim40\%$ of FRBs between $z_{\rm s}\sim0.5-5$ have $\tau\gtrsim1$ ms for $\nu\leq 800$ MHz. Our scattering predictions may be conservative if scattering from circumsource environments is significant, which is possible under specific conditions. The percentage of FRBs selected against from scattering could also be substantially larger than we predict if circumgalactic turbulence causes more small-scale ($\ll1$ au) density fluctuations than observed from nearby halos.",astro-ph.GA

arXiv:2203.12551,"Han-Yue Guo, Hao Wei, ",A Possible Subclassification of Fast Radio Bursts,"Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been an active field in astronomy and cosmology, their origin is still unknown to date. One of the interesting topics is the classification of FRBs, which is closely related to the origin of FRBs. Different physical mechanisms are required by different classes of FRBs. In the literature, they usually could be classified into non-repeating and repeating FRBs. Well motivated by the observations, here we are interested in the possible subclassification of FRBs. By using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we propose to subclassify non-repeating (type I) FRBs into type Ia and Ib FRBs. The distribution of type Ia FRBs is delayed with respect to the cosmic star formation history (SFH), and hence they are probably associated with old stellar populations, while the distribution of type Ib FRBs tracks SFH, and hence they are probably associated with young stellar populations. Accordingly, the physical criteria for this subclassification of type I FRBs have been clearly determined. We find that there are some tight empirical correlations for type Ia FRBs but not for type Ib FRBs, and vice versa. These make them different in physical properties. Similarly, we suggest that repeating (type II) FRBs could also be subclassified into type IIa and IIb FRBs. A universal subclassification scheme is given at the end. This subclassification of FRBs might help us to reveal quite different physical mechanisms behind them, and improve their applications in astronomy and cosmology.",astro-ph.HE

Triggers from 22 FRBs were analyzed with a search that targets compact binary coalescences with at least one neutron star component. A targeted search for generic gravitational-wave transients was conducted on 40 FRBs. We find no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave association in either search. Given the large uncertainties in the distances of the FRBs inferred from the dispersion measures in our sample, however, this does not conclusively exclude any progenitor models that include emission of a gravitational wave of the types searched for from any of these FRB events. We report $90\%$ confidence lower bounds on the distance to each FRB for a range of gravitational-wave progenitor models. By combining the inferred maximum distance information for each FRB with the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave searches, we set upper limits on the energy emitted through gravitational waves for a range of emission scenarios. We find values of order $10^{51}$-$10^{57}$ erg for a range of different emission models with central gravitational wave frequencies in the range 70-3560 Hz.

However, ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is hard to model due to limited information on the local environment of FRBs. In this paper, using 17 well-localized FRBs, we search for the possible correlations between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and the properties of host galaxies, such as the redshift, the stellar mass, the star-formation rate, the age of galaxy, the offset of FRB site from galactic center, and the half-light radius. We find no strong correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and any of the host property. Assuming that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is a constant for all host galaxies, we constrain the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium today to be $f_{\rm IGM,0}=0.78_{-0.19}^{+0.15}$. If we model ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a log-normal distribution, however, we obtain a larger value, $f_{\rm IGM,0}=0.83_{-0.17}^{+0.12}$.

We compare the DM distribution of Parkes and FAST, taking advantage of the similarity between their multibeam receivers. Notwithstanding the limited sample size, we observe a paucity of events at low DM for all evolutionary models considered, resulting in a sharp rise in the observed cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the region of $1000\lesssim\mathrm{DM}\lesssim2000$ pc cm$^{-3}$. These traits could be due to statistical fluctuations ($0.12 \le p \le 0.22$), a complicated energy distribution or break in an energy distribution power law, spatial clustering, observational bias or outliers in the sample (e.g., an excessive DM_${HOST}$ as recently found for FRB 20190520B). The energy distribution in this regime is unlikely to be adequately constrained until further events are detected.

The recently localized FRB 20190520B is extremely active, has the largest confirmed host dispersion measure, and is only the second FRB source associated with a compact, persistent radio source (PRS). The main tracer of the magneto-ionic environments is the rotation measure (RM), a path-integral of the line-of-sight component of magnetic field strength (B) and electron density, which does not allow a direct probe of the B-field configuration. Here we report direct evidence for a B-field reversal based on the observed sign change and extreme variation of FRB 20190520B's RM, which changed from $\sim10000$ rad m$^{-2}$ to $\sim-16000$ rad m$^{-2}$ between June 2021 and January 2022. Such extreme RM reversal has never been observed before in any FRB nor in any astronomical object.

In this work we study the FRB with the hard X-ray $14-195$ keV data from the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. BAT uses coded mask technology giving a localization of $\lesssim 3$ arc-minute in the hard X-ray band, along with an accurate background estimation. BAT has been observing the source location in survey mode since February 2020. The survey mode observations involves background subtracted spectra, integrated over a time span ranging $300-2000$ seconds, at the source location (from Feb 2020-Jan 2022). We analyzed all the $\sim 230$ survey mode observations from BAT and checked for any signal in any of the observations. We did not detect any signal at $>5\sigma$ confidence level in any of the observations. We could estimate a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the $14-195$ keV flux, which ranged between $4.5\times 10^{-10} - 7.6\times 10^{-9}\, \rm erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$. At the source distance this relates to a $5\sigma$ upper limit on luminosity of $5.08\times 10^{44}- 8.5\times 10^{45} \rm erg\, s^{-1}$.

We carried out a multi-wavelength campaign with the FAST radio telescope and NICER X-ray observatory to investigate any possible X-ray emission temporally coincident with the bright radio bursts. The observations took place on 2021 March 4, 9 and 19. We detected five bright radio bursts with FAST, four of which were strictly simultaneous with the NICER observations. The peak flux-density of the radio bursts ranged between $28-105$ mJy, the burst fluence between $27-170$ mJy-ms, and the burst durations between $1.7-12.3$ ms. The radio bursts from FRB~180301 exhibited complex time domain structure, and sub-pulses were detected in individual bursts, with no significant circular polarisation. The linear degree of polarisation in L-band reduced significantly compared to the 2019 observations. We do not detect any X-ray emission in excess of the background during the 5ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1sec and 100sec time intervals at/around the radio-burst barycenter-corrected arrival times, at a $>5\sigma$ confidence level. The $5\sigma$ upper limits on the X-ray a) persistent flux is $<7.64\times 10^{-12}\, \rm erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$ , equivalent to $L_{\rm X}<2.50 \times 10^{45} \rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and b) 5 ms fluence is $<2\times 10^{-11} \rm erg\, cm^{-2}$, at the radio burst regions. Using the $5$ ms X-ray fluence upper limit, we can estimate the radio efficiency $\eta_{R/X} \equiv L_{\rm Radio}/L_{\rm X-ray} \gtrsim 10^{-8}$. The derived upper limit on $\eta_{R/X}$ is consistent with both magnetospheric models and synchrotron maser models involving relativistic shocks.",astro-ph.HE

The chance possibility for the AT2020hur-FRB 180916B association is about 0.04%, which corresponds to a significance of $3.5\sigma$. We develop a giant flare afterglow model to fit AT2020hur. Although the giant flare afterglow model can interpret the observations of AT2020hur, the derived kinetic energy of such a GF is at least three orders of magnitude larger than that of the typical GF, and there is a lot of fine tuning and coincidences required for this model. Another possible explanation is that AT2020hur might consist of two or more optical flares originating from the FRB source, e.g. fast optical bursts produced by the inverse Compton scattering of FRB emission. Besides, AT2020hur is located in one of the activity windows of FRB 180916B, which is an independent support for the association. This coincidence may be due to the reason that the optical counterpart is subject to the same periodic modulation as FRB 180916B, as implied by the prompt FRB counterparts. Future simultaneous observations of FRBs and their optical counterparts may help reveal their physical origin.",astro-ph.HE

One of the leading mechanisms to explain the origin of such coherent radio emission is the curvature radiation process within the dipolar magnetic field structure. It has, however, already been demonstrated that magnetars likely have a more complex magnetic field topology. Here we critically investigate curvature radio emission in the presence of inclined dipolar and quadrupolar (""quadrudipolar"") magnetic fields and show that such field structures differ in their angular characteristics from a purely dipolar case. We analytically show that the shape of open field lines can be modified significantly depending on both the ratio of quadrupole to dipole field strength and their inclination angle at the NS surface. This creates multiple points along each magnetic field line that coincides with the observer's line of sight and may explain the complex spectral and temporal structure of the observed FRBs. We also find that in quadrudipole, the radio beam can take a wider angular range and the beam width can be wider than in pure dipole. This may explain why the pulse width of the transient radio pulsation from magnetars is as large as that of ordinary radio pulsars.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2203.06303,Yi-Qing Lin et al.,Effects of Gravitational Wave Radiation of Eccentric Neutron Star-White Dwarf Binaries on the Periodic Activity of Fast Radio Burst Sources,"We revisit the eccentric neutron star (NS)-white dwarf (WD) binary model for the periodic activity of fast radio burst (FRB) sources, by including the effects of gravitational wave (GW) radiation. In this model, the WD fills its Roche lobe at the periastron and mass transfer occurs from the WD to the NS. The accreted materials can be fragmented and arrive at the NS episodically, resulting in multiple bursts through curvature radiation. Consequently, the WD may be kicked away owing to the conservation of angular momentum. To initiate the next mass transfer, the WD has to refill its Roche lobe through GW radiation. In this scenario, whether the periodic activity can show up relies on three timescales, i.e., the orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$, the timescale $T_{\rm GW}$ for the Roche lobe to be refilled, and the time span $T_{\rm frag}$ for all the episodic events corresponding to each mass transfer process. Only when the two conditions $T_{\rm GW} \gtrsim P_{\rm orb}$ and $T_{\rm frag} < P_{\rm orb}$ are both satisfied, the periodic activity will manifest itself and the period should be equal to $P_{\rm orb}$. In this spirit, the periodic activity is more likely to show up for relatively long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim$ several days). Thus, it is reasonable that FRBs 180916 and 121102, the only two sources having been claimed to manifest periodic activity, both correspond to relatively long periods.",astro-ph.HE

Observations between 400 and 800 MHz, carried out by the CHIME/FRB telescope, in particular, have led to the detection of ~500 FRBs in little more than 1 year and, among them, ~20 repeating sources. Detections at low frequencies have uncovered a nearby population that we can study in detail via continuous monitoring and targeted campaigns. The latest, most important discoveries include: periodicity, both at the days level in repeaters and at the millisecond level in apparently non-repeating sources; the detection of an FRB-like burst from a galactic magnetar; and the localisation of an FRB inside a globular cluster in a nearby galaxy. The systematic study of the population at low frequencies is important for the characterisation of the environment surrounding the FRBs and, at a global level, to understand the environment of the local universe. This review is intended to give an overview of the efforts leading to the current rich variety of low-frequency studies and to put into a common context the results achieved in order to trace a possible roadmap for future progress in the field.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2203.04320,J. F. Mahlmann et al.,Electromagnetic fireworks: Fast radio bursts from rapid reconnection in the compressed magnetar wind,"One scenario for the generation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is magnetic reconnection in a current sheet of the magnetar wind. Compressed by a strong magnetic pulse induced by a magnetar flare, the current sheet fragments into a self-similar chain of magnetic islands. Time-dependent plasma currents at their interfaces produce coherent radiation during their hierarchical coalescence. We investigate this scenario using 2D radiative relativistic particle-in-cell simulations to compute the efficiency of the coherent emission and to obtain frequency scalings. Consistent with expectations, a fraction of the reconnected magnetic field energy, $f\sim 0.002$, is converted to packets of high-frequency fast magnetosonic waves which can escape from the magnetar wind as radio emission. In agreement with analytical estimates, we find that magnetic pulses of $10^{47}\text{erg}\;\text{s}^{-1}$ can trigger relatively narrowband GHz emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{42}\text{erg}\;\text{s}^{-1}$, sufficient to explain bright extragalactic FRBs.

Precise localizations of FRBs can unveil their host galaxies and local environments -- and thus shed light on the physical processes that led to the burst production. However, this has only been achieved for a few FRBs to date. The European VLBI Network (EVN) is currently the only instrument capable of localizing FRBs down to the milliarcsecond level. This level of precision was critical to associate the first localized FRB, 20121102A, to a star-forming region in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy and physically related it to a compact persistent radio source. Analogously, a second repeating FRB, 20180916B, was found to just outside the edge of a prominent star-forming region of a nearby spiral galaxy. The PRECISE project (Pinpointing REpeating ChIme Sources with EVN dishes), starting from 2019, has observed hundreds of hours per year with a subset of EVN telescopes with the goal of localizing repeating FRBs discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. The ultimate goal of PRECISE is to disentangling the environments where FRBs can be produced. Here we present the state of the art of the FRB field, the PRECISE project, and the localizations achieved until now, which have unveiled a variety of environments where FRBs can be found that challenges the current models.",astro-ph.HE

Polarized FRBs originate in highly magnetized environments. We report observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B spanning seventeen months , which show its amount of Faraday rotation is highly variable and twice changes its sign. The FRB also depolarizes below radio frequencies around 1 to 3 GHz. We interpret these properties as due to change in the parallel component of the integrated magnetic field along the line-of-sight, including reversals. This could result from propagation through a turbulent, magnetized screen of plasma located between $10^{-5}$ to 100 parsecs of the FRB source. This is consistent with the bursts passing through the stellar wind of a binary companion of the FRB source.",astro-ph.HE

Using this algorithm we identified two major classes of FRBs featuring different waveform morphology, and, simultaneously, different distribution of brightness temperature.

In this work, we show that the four typical late-universe cosmological probes, the 21 cm intensity mapping (IM), fast radio burst (FRB), gravitational wave (GW) standard siren, and strong gravitational lensing (SGL), are expected to be forged into useful tools in solving the Hubble tension and exploring dark energy. We propose that the synergy of them is rather important in cosmology. We simulate the 21 cm IM, FRB, GW, and SGL data based on the hypothetical observations of the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the Einstein Telescope (ET), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), respectively. We find that the four probes show obviously different parameter degeneracy orientations in cosmological constraints, so any combination of them can break the parameter degeneracies and thus significantly improve the constraint precision. The joint 21 cm IM+FRB+GW+SGL data can provide the constraint errors of $\sigma(\Omega_{\rm m})=0.0022$ and $\sigma(H_0)=0.16\ \rm km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, which meet the standard of precision cosmology, i.e., the constraint precision of parameters is better than 1%. In addition, the joint data give $\sigma(w)=0.020$ in the $w$CDM model, and $\sigma(w_0)=0.066$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.25$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, which are all better than the constraints obtained by the CMB+BAO+SN data. We show that the synergy between the four late-universe cosmological probes has magnificent prospects.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2202.09602,Yuan-Pei Yang et al.,"Temporal Scattering, Depolarization, and Persistent Radio Emission from Magnetized Inhomogeneous Environments Near Repeating Fast Radio Burst Sources","Some repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources exhibit complex polarization behaviors, including frequency-dependent depolarization, variation of rotation measure (RM), and oscillating spectral structures of polarized components. Very recently, Feng et al. (2022) reported that active repeaters exhibit conspicuous frequency-dependent depolarization and a strong correlation between RM scatter ($\sigma_{\rm RM}$) and the temporal scattering time ($\tau_{\rm s}$), $\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{1.0\pm0.2}$, both of which can be well described by multi-path propagation through a magnetized inhomogeneous plasma screen. This observation strongly suggests that the temporal scattering and RM scatter originate from the same region. Besides, a particular finding of note in Feng et al. (2022) is that the FRBs with compact persistent radio sources (PRS) tend to have extreme $\sigma_{\rm RM}$. In this work, we focus on some theoretical predictions on the relations among temporal scattering, depolarization by RM scatter, and PRS contributed by the magnetized plasma environment close to a repeating FRB source. The behaviors of the RM scatter imply that the magnetized plasma environment is consistent with a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, and the predicted $\sigma_{\rm RM}$-$\tau_{\rm s}$ relation is $\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{(0.54-0.83)}$ for different astrophysical scenarios. We further make a general discussion on PRS that does not depend on specific astrophysical scenarios. We show that the specific luminosity of a PRS should have a positive correlation with the RM contributed by the plasma screen. This is consistent with the observations of FRB 121102 and FRB 190520B.",astro-ph.HE

We report polarization measurements of five repeating FRBs, the abundant signals of which enable wide-band observations with two telescopes. A clear trend of lower polarization at lower frequencies was found, which can be well characterized by a single parameter rotation-measure-scatter ({\sigma}RM) and modeled by multi-path scatter. Sources with higher {\sigma}RM have higher RM magnitude and scattering timescales. The two sources with the most substantial {\sigma}RM, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are associated with a compact persistent radio source.

arXiv:2202.08002,InÃ©s Pastor-Marazuela et al.,A fast radio burst with sub-millisecond quasi-periodic structure,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients of extraordinary luminosity. Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently observed in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class. For example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate the rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission. Periodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently reported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced by 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important clues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that of FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the main FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A components to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these against the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with sub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from repeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the periodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5$\sigma$. Its repeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the required spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star equations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict with a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could, however, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the smallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star rotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Significant circular polarization is reported in both apparently non-repeating and repeating FRBs. Curvature radiation can produce significant circular polarization at the wing of the radiation beam. In the curvature radiation scenario, in order to see significant circular polarization in FRBs (1) more energetic bursts, (2) burst with electrons having higher Lorentz factor, (3) a slowly rotating neutron star at the centre are required. Different rotational period of the central neutron star may explain why some FRBs have high circular polarization, while others don't. Considering possible difference in refractive index for the parallel and perpendicular component of electric field, the position angle may change rapidly over the narrow pulse window of the radiation beam. The position angle swing in FRBs may also be explained by this non-geometric origin, besides that of the rotating vector model.",astro-ph.HE

If repeating and non-repeating FRBs belong to one population, their distribution distinctions for the repetition rate and duration can be explained by the selection effect due to the beamed emission as in Connor et al. (2020). However, we obtain that the distribution distinctions for the spectral index and potentially the peak frequency cannot be explained by the beamed emission within the framework of either the coherent curvature radiation or synchrotron maser emission. This indicates that there could be two populations. We further discuss three possible scenarios for the required two populations.",astro-ph.HE

We use Bayesian evidence and realistic mock data sets constructed with AGAMA to select between different mass models. In both clusters, the velocities are consistent with isotropy within the extent of our data. We robustly detect a dark central mass (DCM) of roughly 1000 solar masses in both clusters. Our MAMPOSSt-PM fits strongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild preference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few per cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind our results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching the phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of the DCM. The internal kinematics are thus consistent with a population of hundreds of massive white dwarfs in NGC 6397, and roughly 100 segregated stellar-mass black holes in NGC 3201, as previously found with CMC. Such analyses confirm the accuracy of both mass-orbit modelling and Monte Carlo N-body techniques, which together provide more robust predictions on the DCM of globular clusters (core-collapsed or not). This opens possibilities to understand a vast range of interesting astrophysical phenomena in clusters, such as fast radio bursts, compact object mergers, and gravitational waves.",astro-ph.GA

The model has three ingredients -- compact object, progenitor with effective magnetic field strength around $10^{10}~{\rm Gauss}$, and GHz frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The energy conversion from GWs to electromagnetic waves occurs when GWs pass through the magnetosphere of such compact objects due to the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich effect. This conversion produces bursts of electromagnetic waves in the GHz range, leading to FRBs. Our model has three key features: (i) can generate peak-flux up to $1000~{\rm Jy}$, (ii) can naturally explain the pulse-width and (iii) predict FRB's random and repeating nature with a wide flux range. We thus conclude that the millisecond pulsars could be the progenitor of FRBs. Further, our model offers a novel perspective on the indirection detection of GWs at high-frequency beyond detection capabilities. Thus, transient events like FRBs are a rich source for the current era of multi-messenger astronomy.",astro-ph.HE

CHIME is located at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, BC Canada. The instrument is designed to map neutral hydrogen over the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5 to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. This goal drives the design features of the instrument. CHIME consists of four parallel cylindrical reflectors, oriented north-south, each 100 m $\times$ 20 m and outfitted with a 256 element dual-polarization linear feed array. CHIME observes a two degree wide stripe covering the entire meridian at any given moment, observing 3/4 of the sky every day due to Earth rotation. An FX correlator utilizes FPGAs and GPUs to digitize and correlate the signals, with different correlation products generated for cosmological, fast radio burst, pulsar, VLBI, and 21 cm absorber backends. For the cosmology backend, the $N_\mathrm{feed}^2$ correlation matrix is formed for 1024 frequency channels across the band every 31 ms. A data receiver system applies calibration and flagging and, for our primary cosmological data product, stacks redundant baselines and integrates for 10 s. We present an overview of the instrument, its performance metrics based on the first three years of science data, and we describe the current progress in characterizing CHIME's primary beam response. We also present maps of the sky derived from CHIME data; we are using versions of these maps for a cosmological stacking analysis as well as for investigation of Galactic foregrounds.",astro-ph.IM

We find that the FRB host has an HI mass of $\rm M_{HI} = (2.74 \pm 0.33) \times 10^9 \ M_\odot$ and a high HI-to-stellar mass ratio, $\approx 1.3$. The FRB host is thus a gas-rich but near-quiescent galaxy, that is likely to have acquired a significant mass of HI in the recent past. The HI distribution is disturbed, with extended HI 21cm emission detected in a north-eastern tail, a counter-tail towards the south, an HI hole between the galaxy centre and the FRB location, and a high HI column density measured close to the FRB position. The FRB host is part of a group with four companions detected in their HI 21cm emission, the nearest of which is only 22~kpc from the FRB location. The gas-richness and disturbed HI distribution indicate that the FRB host has recently undergone a minor merger, which increased its HI mass, disturbed the HI in the galaxy disk, and compressed the HI near the FRB location to increase its surface density. We propose that this merger caused the burst of star-formation in the outskirts of the galaxy that gave rise to the FRB progenitor. The evidence for a minor merger is consistent with scenarios in which the FRB progenitor is a massive star, formed due to the merger event.",astro-ph.GA

If we can identify cosmological statistics that are robust against these uncertainties, or constrain these effects by other means, then we can enhance the power of current and upcoming observations from weak lensing surveys such as DES, Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, and the Roman Space Telescope. In this work, we investigate the potential of the electron density auto-power spectrum as a robust probe of cosmology and baryonic feedback. We use a suite of (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS project and perform an idealized analysis to forecast statistical uncertainties on a limited set of cosmological and physically-motivated astrophysical parameters. We find that the electron number density auto-correlation, measurable through either kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations or through Fast Radio Burst dispersion measures, provides tight constraints on $\Omega_{m}$ and the mean baryon fraction in intermediate-mass halos, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{bar}}$. By obtaining an empirical measure for the associated systematic uncertainties, we find these constraints to be largely robust to differences in baryonic feedback models implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.

Subtracting the contributions of the intergalactic medium and our Milky Way Galaxy from the total DM, one gets an excess of around 200 pc cm$^{-3}$, which may have been contributed by the host galaxy of the FRB. It is found in this work that the position of FRB 191001 is consistent with the distribution of supernovae (SNe) in the spiral arm of their parent galaxies. If this event is indeed due to an SN explosion, then, from the analysis of the SN contributions to the excess DM, a core-collapse (CC) channel is preferred over a thermonuclear runaway. For the CC explosion, depending on the density of the surrounding medium, the age of the central engine that powers the radio burst is within a couple of years to a few decades.

Revealing the origin of FRBs is becoming central in astronomy. The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e., the number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important implications for the FRB progenitors. Here we show the energy functions of FRBs selected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) catalogue using the $V_{\rm max}$ method. The $V_{\rm max}$ method allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as it is without any prior assumption on the evolution. We use a homogeneous sample of 164 non-repeating FRB sources, which are about one order of magnitude larger than previously investigated samples. The energy functions of non-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at $z\lesssim1$. The energy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards higher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is no significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic stellar-mass density evolution with a 1\% significance threshold, whereas the cosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99\% confidence level. Our results indicate that the event rate of non-repeating FRBs is likely controlled by old populations rather than young populations which are traced by the cosmic star-formation rate density. This suggests old populations such as old neutron stars and black holes as more likely progenitors of non-repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

We present a detailed observational study of QRS121102 and its host galaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its flux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the K-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic refractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at the host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the scintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the possibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated the mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with QRS121102 from the width of the H\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution optical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity dispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the SMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity constraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN. Finally, some dwarf galaxies that host SMBH may be the stripped cores of massive galaxies during the tidal interactions with companion systems. We find no nearby galaxy at the same redshift as the QRS121102 host from low-resolution Keck spectra, or from the PanSTARRS catalog. In conclusion, we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis that the persistent radio source associated with FRB 121102 is an AGN. We instead argue that the inferred size, and the flat radio spectrum, favors a plerion interpretation. We urge continued broadband radio monitoring of QRS121102 to search for long-term evolution, and the detailed evaluation of potential analogs that may provide greater insight into the nature of this class of object.",astro-ph.HE

We propose to use brightness temperature to separate two subtypes. For FRB 20121102A, the critical brightness temperature is $T_{\rm B,cri}\simeq10^{33}\,\rm K$. Bursts with $T_{\rm B}\geq T_{\rm B,cri}$ are denoted as ""classical"" FRBs, and further we find a tight pulse width-fluence relation ($T\propto\mathcal{F_\nu}^{0.306}$) for them. On the contrary, the other bursts are considered as ""atypical"" bursts that may originate from a different physical process.

arXiv:2112.10964,"Yu Zhang, Hui-Chun Wu, ",Upper Field Strength Limit of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmological radio transients with unclear generation mechanism. Known characteristics such as their luminosity, duration, spectrum and repetition rate, etc. suggest that FRBs are powerful coherent radio signals at GHz frequencies, but the status of FRBs near source remain unknown. As an extreme astronomical event, FRBs should be accompanied by energy -- comparable or even more powerful x/{\gamma}-ray counterparts. Here, particle-in-cell simulations of ultra-strong GHz radio pulse interaction with GeV photons show that at 3*10^12V/cm field-strengths, quantum cascade can generate dense pair plasmas, which greatly dampen the radio pulse. Thus, in the presence of GeV photons in the source region, GHz radio pulses stronger than 3*10^12V/cm cannot escape. This result indicates an upper field-strength limit of FRB at the source.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2112.09782,Marcio G. B. de Avellar et al.,Sudden discharge of young charged magnetars as a new model for FRBs,"We propose a new model for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) based on a sudden discharge of a charged young magnetar, caused by the short falling timescale of oppositely charged particles onto the magnetar. In this scenario, curvature radiation is emitted by particles accelerated at relativistic by the strong electric fields produced by the disconnection and the subsequent reconnection of the magnetic field lines, a process triggered by the sudden discharge. We modeled the magnetars as charged neutron stars in the static approximation using the exterior metric by the Reissner-Nordstr\""om. We also adopted an electrical charge distribution proportional to the mass-energy density, although our results are not strongly sensitive to the specific star charge distribution, only to the total charge. Our calculations show that the discharge and emission timescales are several milliseconds, compatible with the FRB phenomena for magnetars with a total charge of $\sim 10^{20}~\mathrm{C}$ and mass and radius in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and 10 to 45 km, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated total emitted power of a coherent pulse is $P_{tot}\sim 10^{42-43} erg/s$, and the frequency range and time scale are also consistent with FRBs astronomical observations. Finally, if the magnetar does not collapse after the discharge, the existence of FRB repeater sources can not rule out the existence of a blast repetition after the time needed to magnetosphere recharges and produce a new discharge.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2112.07639,Jerome Seebeck et al.,The Effects of Selection Biases on the Analysis of Localised Fast Radio Bursts,"The objects that emit extragalatic fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unidentified. Studies of the host galaxies and environments of accurately localised ($\lesssim1$ arcsec) FRBs promise to deliver critical insights into the nature of their progenitors. Here we demonstrate the effects of observational selection biases on analyses of the distributions of FRB host-galaxy properties (including star-formation rate, SFR, and stellar mass, $M_{*}$), and on the distributions of FRB offsets from the centres of their hosts. We consider the effects of ""radio selection"", wherein FRBs with larger dispersion measures and scattering timescales are less likely to be detected, and the effects of ""optical selection"", wherein FRBs with fainter host galaxies are more likely to have unidentified or mis-identified hosts. We develop a plausible, illustrative model for these effects in observations of FRBs and their host galaxies by combining the output catalogues of a semi-analytic galaxy formation model with a recently developed algorithm to associate FRBs with host galaxies (PATH). We find that optical selection biases are most important for the host-galaxy $M_{*}$ and SFR distributions, and that radio selection biases are most important for the distribution of FRB projected physical offsets. For our fiducial simulation of FRBs at $z<0.5$, the selection biases cause the median host-galaxy SFR to be increased by $\sim0.3$ dex, and the median $M_{*}$ by $\sim0.5$ dex. The median projected physical offset is increased by $\sim2$ kpc ($\sim0.25$ dex). These effects are sufficiently large so as to merit careful consideration in studies of localised FRBs, and our simulations provide a guide towards their mitigation.",astro-ph.HE

Although not directly taken during a bursting period the counterpart is a factor of ~1.5 to 2.5 brighter than seen at previous epochs with F140W(AB) = $24.65\pm0.02$ mag. We do not detect significant variations of the NIR counterpart within the course of any one orbit (i.e. on minutes-hour timescales), and contemporaneous X-ray observations show SGR 1935+2154 to be at the quiescent level. With a time baseline of 6 years from the first identification of the counter-part we place stringent limits on the proper motion of the source, with a measured proper motion of ${\mu} = 3.1\pm1.5$ mas/yr. The direction of proper motion indicates an origin of SGR 1935+2154 very close to the geometric centre of SNR G57.2+08, further strengthening their association. At an adopted distance of $6.6\pm0.7$ kpc, the corresponding tangential space velocity is ${\nu_T} = 97\pm48$ km/s (corrected for differential Galactic rotation and peculiar Solar motion), although its formal statistical determination may be compromised owing to few epochs of observation. The current velocity estimate places it at the low end of the kick distribution for pulsars, and makes it among the lowest known magnetar kicks. When collating the few-magnetar kick constraints available, we find full consistency between the magnetar kick distribution and the much larger pulsar kick sample",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2112.07017,Emanuele Sobacchi et al.,Filamentation of Fast Radio Bursts in magnetar winds,"Magnetars are the most promising progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Strong radio waves propagating through the magnetar wind are subject to non-linear effects, including modulation/filamentation instabilities. We derive the dispersion relation for modulations of strong waves propagating in magnetically-dominated pair plasmas focusing on dimensionless strength parameters $a_0\lesssim 1$, and discuss implications for FRBs. As an effect of the instability, the FRB radiation intensity develops sheets perpendicular to the direction of the wind magnetic field. When the FRB front expands outside the radius where the instability ends, the radiation sheets are scattered due to diffraction. The FRB scattering timescale depends on the properties of the magnetar wind. In a cold wind, the typical scattering timescale is $\tau_{\rm sc}\sim{\rm\; \mu s-ms}$ at the frequency $\nu\sim 1{\rm\; GHz}$. The scattering timescale increases at low frequencies, with the scaling $\tau_{\rm sc}\propto\nu^{-2}$. The frequency-dependent broadening of the brightest pulse of FRB 181112 is consistent with this scaling. From the scattering timescale of the pulse, one can estimate that the wind Lorentz factor is larger than a few tens. In a warm wind, the scattering timescale can approach $\tau_{\rm sc}\sim{\rm\; ns}$. Then scattering produces a frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a large bandwidth, $\Delta\nu\sim 1/\tau_{\rm sc}\gtrsim 100{\rm\; MHz}$. Broadband frequency modulations observed in FRBs could be due to scattering in a warm magnetar wind.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2112.06719,Wei-Yang Wang et al.,Repeating Fast Radio Burst: Coherent Circular Polarization By Bunches,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration signals that are highly dispersed at distant galaxies. However, the physical origin of FRBs is still unknown. Coherent curvature emission by bunches, e.g., powered by starquakes, has already been proposed for repeating FRBs. It has the nature of understanding narrowband radiation exhibiting time--frequency drifting. Recently, a highly active FRB source, i.e., FRB 20201124A, was reported to enter a newly active episode and emit at least some highly circular-polarized bursts. In this study, we revisit the polarized FRB emission, particularly investigating the production mechanisms of a highly circular polarization (CP) by deriving the intrinsic mechanism and propagative effect. The intrinsic mechanisms of invoking charged bunches are approached with radiative coherence. Consequently, a highly CP could naturally be explained by the coherent summation of outcome waves, generated or scattered by bunches, with different phases and electric vectors. Different kinds of evolutionary trajectories are found on the Poincare sphere for the bunch-coherent polarization, and this behavior could be tested through future observations. Cyclotron resonance can result in the absorption of R-mode photons at a low altitude region of the magnetosphere, and an FRB should then be emitted from a high-altitude region if the waves have strong linear polarization. Circularly polarized components could be produced from Faraday conversion exhibiting a \lambda^3-oscillation, but the average CP fraction depends only on the income wave, indicating a possibility of a highly circular-polarized income wave.The analysis could be welcome if extremely high CP from repeating FRBs is detected in the future. Finally, the production of a bulk of energetic bunches in the pulsar-like magnetosphere is discussed, which is relevant to the nature of the FRB central engine.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2112.03721,"Keren Krochek, Ely D. Kovetz, ",Constraining Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with CHIME Fast Radio Bursts,"Strong lensing of Fast Radio Bursts (FBRs) has been proposed as a relatively clean probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. Recently, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) published a first catalog of 536 FRBs, 62 of which are from repeating sources. In light of this new data, we re-examine the prospects to constrain the abundance of PBHs via FRBs. Extending previous forecasts, we calculate a PBH dark matter bound using the intrinsic burst width and a calibrated flux-ratio threshold per FRB. In addition, we take into account the uncertainty in the relation between the FRB dispersion measure and source redshift. We outline an algorithm to detect lensed FRBs and a method to simulate its performance on real data and set a flux-ratio threshold for each event, which we use to infer realistic forecasts. We then attempt to extract a preliminary bound using the publicly available CHIME data. Unfortunately, both instrumental noise and the provided ~1 ms time-resolution of the public data hinder this effort. We identify one candidate event where a double burst could be explained via strong lensing by a 10 solar-mass PBH, which will require follow-up study at higher time resolution to either confirm or discard. We show that with a few times the size of the first catalog -- sampled at the full instrumental time-resolution so that candidates can be efficiently scrutinized -- CHIME will be able to find strong evidence for or robustly rule out PBHs with mass above 10 solar masses as the dark matter. Finally, we demonstrate that stacking repeating FRBs can improve the constraints, especially for lower masses.",astro-ph.CO

Recently, an FRB-like event was seen from the Milky Way magnetar SGR 1935+2154 by the CHIME and STARE2 telescopes. This is the only magnetar that has produced FRB events in our galaxy. Finding similar events in the Milky Way is of great interest to understanding FRB progenitors. Such events will be strongly affected by the turbulent interstellar medium in the Milky Way, their intrinsic energy distribution and their spatial locations within the plane of the Milky Way. We examine these effects using models for the distribution of electrons in the ISM to estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events, and a range of models for the spatial distribution and luminosity functions, including models motivated by the spatial distribution of the Milky Way's magnetars. We evaluate the fraction of FRB events in the Milky Way that are detectable by STARE2 for a range of ISM models, spatial distributions and burst luminosity functions. In all the models examined, only a fraction of burst events are detectable, mainly due to the scattering effects of the ISM. We find that GReX, a proposed all-sky experiment, could increase the detection rate of Milky Way FRB events by an order of magnitude, depending on assumptions made about the luminosity function and scale-height of the FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

The DM excess over the intergalactic medium and Galactic contributions is estimated as $\sim 900$ pc cm$^{-3}$, which is nearly ten times higher than other fast radio bursts (FRBs) host galaxies. The DM decreases with the rate $\sim0.1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ per day. It is the second FRB associated with a compact persistent radio source (PRS). The rotation measure (RM) is found to be larger than $1.8 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{rad} ~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. In this letter, we argue that FRB 190520B is powered by a young magentar formed by core-collapse of massive stars, embedded in a composite of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) and supernova remnant (SNR). The energy injection of the magnetar drives the MWN and SN ejecta to evolve together, and the PRS is generated by the synchrotron radiation of the MWN. The magnetar has the interior magnetic field $B_{\text{int}}\sim (2-4)\times 10^{16}$ G and the age $t_{\text{age}}\sim 14-22$ yr. The dense SN ejecta and the shocked shell contribute a large fraction of the observed DM and RM.

However, much more FRBs are required to tightly constrain the dipole direction. Even 1000 FRBs are far from enough to constrain the dipole direction within angular uncertainty $\Delta\theta<40^{\circ}$ at 95\% confidence level. The uncertainty on the dispersion measure of host galaxy does not significantly affect the results.

arXiv:2111.12269,"Yuanhong Qu, Bing Zhang, Pawan Kumar, ",The plasma suppression effect can be ignored in realistic FRB models invoking bunched coherent radio emission,"One widely discussed mechanism to produce highly coherent radio emission of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is coherent emission by bunches, either via curvature radiation or inverse Compton scattering (ICS). It has been suggested that the plasma oscillation effect can significantly suppress coherent emission power by bunches. We examine this criticism in this paper. The suppression factor formalism was derived within the context of radio pulsars in which radio waves are in the low-amplitude, linear regime and cannot directly be applied to the large-amplitude, non-linear regime relevant for FRBs. Even if one applies this linear treatment, plasma suppression is not important for two physical reasons. First, for an efficient radiation mechanism such as ICS, the required plasma density is not high so that a high-density plasma may not exist. Second, both bunched coherent mechanisms demand that a large global parallel electric field ($E_\parallel$) must exist in the emission region in order to continuously inject energy to the bunches to power an FRB. In order to produce typical FRB duration via coherent curvature or ICS radiation, a parallel electric field must be present to balance the acceleration and radiation back-reaction. The plasma suppression factor should be modified with the existence of $E_\parallel$. We show that the correction factor for curvature radiation, $f_{\rm cur}$, increases with $E_\parallel$ and becomes 1 when $E_\parallel$ reaches the radiation-reaction-limited regime. We conclude that the plasma suppression effect can be ignored for realistic FRB emission models invoking bunched coherent radio emission.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2111.11841,Wei-Yang Wang et al.,Magnetospheric curvature radiation by bunches as emission mechanism for repeating fast radio bursts,"Coherent curvature radiation as the radiation mechanism for fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been discussed since FRBs were discovered. We study the spectral and polarization properties of repeating FRBs within the framework of coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a highly magnetized neutron star. The spectra can be generally characterized by multisegment broken power laws, and evolve as bunches move and the line of sight sweeps. Emitted waves are highly linear polarized if the line of sight is confined to the beam within an angle of $1/\gamma$, while circular polarized degree becomes strong for off-beam cases. The spectro-temporal pulse-to-pulse properties can be a natural consequence due to the magnetospheric geometry. We investigate the relationship between drift rate, central frequency and their temporal duration. The radius-to-frequency mapping is derived and simulated within the assumptions of both dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic configurations. The geometric results show that FRBs are emitted in field lines more curved than open field lines for a dipolar geometry. This suggests that there are most likely existing multipolar magnetic configurations in the emission region.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2111.11764,H. Xu et al.,A fast radio burst source at a complex magnetised site in a barred galaxy,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts. Recent observations of a Galactic FRB suggest that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars, but the origin of cosmological FRBs is still not settled. Here we report the detection of 1863 bursts in 82 hr over 54 days from the repeating source FRB~20201124A. These observations show irregular short-time variation of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), which probes the density-weighted line-of-sight magnetic field strength, of individual bursts during the first 36 days, followed by a constant RM. We detected circular polarisation in more than half of the burst sample, including one burst reaching a high fractional circular polarisation of 75%. Oscillations in fractional linear and circular polarisations as well as polarisation angle as a function of wavelength were detected. All of these features provide evidence for a complicated, dynamically evolving, magnetised immediate environment within about an astronomical unit (au; Earth-Sun distance) of the source. Our optical observations of its Milky-Way-sized, metal-rich host galaxy reveal a barred spiral, with the FRB source residing in a low stellar density, interarm region at an intermediate galactocentric distance. This environment is inconsistent with a young magnetar engine formed during an extreme explosion of a massive star that resulted in a long gamma-ray burst or superluminous supernova.",astro-ph.HE

Here we report on the analysis of 478 bursts (333 previously unreported) from FRB 20121102A using the 305-m Arecibo telescope - detected during approximately 59 hours of observations between December 2015 and October 2016. The majority of bursts are from a burst storm around September 2016. This is the earliest available sample of a large number of FRB 20121102A bursts, and it thus provides an anchor point for long-term studies of the source's evolving properties. We observe that the bursts separate into two groups in the width-bandwidth-energy parameter space, which we refer to as the low-energy bursts (LEBs) and high-energy bursts (HEBs). The LEBs are typically longer duration and narrower bandwidth than the HEBs, reminiscent of the spectro-temporal differences observed between the bursts of repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We fit the cumulative burst rate-energy distribution with a broken power-law and find that it flattens out toward higher energies. The sample shows a diverse zoo of burst morphologies. Notably, burst emission seems to be more common at the top than the bottom of our 1150 - 1730 MHz observing band. We also observe that bursts from the same day appear to be more similar to each other than to those of other days, but this observation requires confirmation. The wait times and burst rates that we measure are consistent with previous studies. We discuss these results, primarily in the context of magnetar models.",astro-ph.HE

An analytical treatment of Lyutikov (2020) is presented. The frequency dependence of the drifting rate and the drifting timescale are obtained. The aberration effect and the twist of the magnetic field lines may result in drifting in both directions. For one FRB, the burst width is larger at lower frequency according to the radius-to-frequency mapping. For the FRB population, the magnetic fields of the repeaters may be larger than that of the non-repeaters. Then, according to the radius-to-frequency mapping, the burst widths of the repeaters will be wider than that of the apparent non-repeaters. If similar window function (or emission cones) like that of pulsars and magnetars is also at work in the case of FRBs, then the window function may explain the single or multiple components of FRB profiles. The radius-to-frequency mapping modeling is to some degree independent of the underlying radio emission mechanism.",astro-ph.HE

This energy band is of key importance for multi-messenger and multi-wavelength studies but it is nevertheless currently under-explored. AMEGO-X addresses this situation by proposing a design capable of detecting and imaging gamma rays via both Compton interactions and pair production processes. However, some of the objects that AMEGO-X will study, such as gamma-ray bursts and magnetars, extend to energies below ~100 keV where the dominant interaction becomes photoelectric absorption. These events deposit their energy in a single pixel of the detector. In this work we show how the ~3500 cm^2 effective area of the AMEGO-X tracker to events between ~25 keV to ~100 keV will be utilized to significantly improve its sensitivity and expand the energy range for transient phenomena. Although imaging is not possible for single-site events, we show how we will localize a transient source in the sky using their aggregate signal to within a few degrees. This technique will more than double the number of cosmological gamma-ray bursts seen by AMEGO-X, allow us to detect and resolve the pulsating tails of extragalactic magnetar giant flares, and increase the number of detected less-energetic magnetar bursts -- some possibly associated with fast radio bursts. Overall, single-site events will increase the sensitive energy range, expand the science program, and promptly alert the community of fainter transient events.",astro-ph.HE

However, the degree of magnetization $\sigma$ and the magnetic field geometry in shock-powered GRB/FRB scenarios are still poorly constrained by observations. Analogous to the magnetization $\sigma$ associated with the total field strength, we define a tangential magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ associated with the tangential field component. We explore the jump conditions of magnetized relativistic shocks, either with an ordered field of arbitrary inclination angle or with a random field of arbitrary anisotropy. In either case, we find that the jump conditions of relativistic shocks are governed by the tangential magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ instead of the total magnetization $\sigma$, insensitive to the inclination angles or the anisotropy of the pre-shock magnetic field.

To investigate the limits of single-plane plasma lensing, we set up a double-plane lens with a projected Gaussian electron density in each lens plane. We compare double-plane scenarios with corresponding effective single-plane configurations. Our results show how double-plane lenses can be distinguished from single-plane lenses by observables, i.e. resolved multiple image positions, relative magnifications, time delays, and pulse shapes. For plasma lensing of fast radio bursts, the observed pulse shape may be dominated by the lensing effect, allowing us to neglect the intrinsic source pulse shape to distinguish different lensing configurations.

Recently, the first CHIME/FRB catalog of 536 events was released. Such a large uniform sample of FRBs detected by a single telescope is very valuable to test the FRB distributions. Later, it has been claimed that the FRB distribution model tracking the cosmic star formation history (SFH) was rejected by the first CHIME/FRB catalog. In the present work, we consider some empirical FRB distribution models, and find that many of them can be fully consistent with the CHIME/FRB observational data for some suitable model parameters. Notice that a suppressed evolution with respect to SFH is commonly found for FRBs. In particular, we independently confirm that the FRB distribution model tracking SFH can be rejected at very high confidence. On the other hand, all the ``successful'' models effectively require a certain degree of ``delay'' with respect to SFH.

The difference found between SF and that derived from CF at $\theta \lesssim 10^\circ$ can be ascribed to the large statistical uncertainties or the density inhomogeneities on scales on the order of $100$ Mpc.

Here we propose a family of model invoking coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of bunched particles that may operate within or just outside of the magnetosphere of a flaring magnetar. Crustal oscillations during the flaring event may excite low-frequency electromagnetic waves near the magnetar surface. The X-mode of these waves could penetrate through the magnetosphere. Bunched relativistic particles in the charge starved region inside the magnetosphere or in the current sheet outside of the magnetosphere would upscatter these low-frequency waves to produce GHz emission to power FRBs. The ICS mechanism has a much larger emission power for individual electrons than curvature radiation. This greatly reduces the required degree of coherence in bunches, alleviating several criticisms to the bunching mechanism raised in the context of curvature radiation. The emission is $\sim 100\%$ linearly polarized (with the possibility of developing circular polarization) with a constant or varying polarization angle across each burst. The mechanism can account for a narrow-band spectrum and a frequency downdrifting pattern, as commonly observed in repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Nimmo et al.,Milliarcsecond localisation of the repeating FRB 20201124A,"Very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) localisations of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) have demonstrated a diversity of local environments: from nearby star-forming regions to globular clusters. Here we report the VLBI localisation of FRB 20201124A using an ad-hoc array of dishes that also participate in the European VLBI Network (EVN). In our campaign, we detected 18 total bursts from FRB 20201124A at two separate epochs. By combining the visibilities from both observing epochs, we were able to localise FRB 20201124A with a 1-$\sigma$ error of 4.5 milliarcseconds (mas). We use the relatively large burst sample to investigate astrometric accuracy, and find that for $\gtrsim20$ baselines ($\gtrsim7$ dishes) that we can robustly reach milliarcsecond precision even using single-burst data sets. Sub-arcsecond precision is still possible for single bursts, even when only $\sim$ six baselines (four dishes) are available. We explore two methods for determining the individual burst positions: the peaks of the dirty maps and a Gaussian fit to the cross fringe pattern on the dirty maps. We found the latter to be more reliable due to the lower mean and standard deviation in the offsets from the FRB position. Our VLBI work places FRB 20201124A 705$\pm$26 mas (1-$\sigma$ errors) from the optical centre of the host galaxy, and consistent with originating from within the recently-discovered extended radio structure associated with star-formation in the host galaxy. Future high-resolution optical observations, e.g. with Hubble Space Telescope, can determine the proximity of our FRB 20201124A VLBI position to nearby knots of star formation.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2111.00281,"Maxim Lyutikov, ",Faraday rotation in fast radio bursts,"Fast Radio Bursts (FBRs) show highly different polarization properties: high/small RMs, high/small circular/linear fractions. We outline a complicated picture of polarization propagation in the inner parts of the magnetars' winds, at scales $\sim$ few to hundreds of light cylinder radii. The key point is the Faraday rotation of linear polarization in highly magnetized symmetric pair plasma, a $\propto B^2$ effect. Position angle (PA) rotation rate is maximal for propagation across the magnetic field and disappears only for parallel propagation. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega \ll \omega_B$, it becomes independent of the magnetic field. Very specific properties of PA($\lambda$) (scaling of the rotation angle with the observed wavelength $\lambda$) can help identify/sort out the propagation effects. Two basic regimes in pair plasma predict PA $\propto \lambda$ and $\propto \lambda^3$ (depending on the magnetic dominance); both are different from the conventional plasma's PA = RM $ \lambda^2$. This is the main prediction of the model. A number of effects, all sensitive to the underlying parameters, contribute to the observed complicated polarization patterns: streaming of plasma along magnetic field lines near the light cylinder, Faraday depolarization, effects of limiting polarization, the associated effect of linear-circular conversion, and synchrotron absorption.",astro-ph.HE

Aggarwal, ",On the Fast Radio Burst and Persistent Radio Source Populations,"The first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) to be precisely localized was associated with a luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Recently, a second FRB/PRS association was discovered for another repeating source of FRBs. However, it is not clear what makes FRBs or PRS or how they are related. We compile FRB and PRS properties to consider the population of FRB/PRS sources. We suggest a practical definition for PRS as FRB associations with luminosity greater than $10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ that is not attributed to star-formation activity in the host galaxy. We model the probability distribution of the fraction of FRBs with PRS for repeaters and non-repeaters, showing there is not yet evidence for repeaters to be preferentially associated with PRS. We discuss how FRB/PRS sources may be distinguished by the combination of active repetition and an excess dispersion measure local to the FRB environment. We use CHIME/FRB event statistics to bound the mean per-source repetition rate of FRBs to be between 25 and 440 yr$^{-1}$. We use this to provide a bound on the density of FRB-emitting sources in the local universe of between $2.2\times10^2$ and $5.2\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$ assuming a pulsar-like beam width for FRB emission. This density implies that PRS may comprise as much as 1\% of compact, luminous radio sources detected in the local universe. The cosmic density and phenomenology of PRS are similar to that of the newly-discovered, off-nuclear ""wandering"" AGN. We argue that it is likely that some PRS have already been detected and misidentified as AGN.",astro-ph.HE

We consider photo-magnetic interactions and show that the high-energy radiation can produce pairs which screen the accelerating electric field. We find that to avoid catastrophic cascades that quench emission, bunches capable of producing FRBs must have a modest density $n_e \approx 10^{13-14}\, {\rm cm^{-3}}$, and likely propagate along field lines with large curvature radii, $\rho > 10^8 \, {\rm cm}$.

The primary objective of the survey was to search for fast radio transients, including Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). We used the 7-beam ALFA receiver to observe different sections of the sky within the declination region $\sim$(10$-$20) deg on 23 nights and collected 160 hours of data in total. We searched our data for single-pulse transients, covering up to a maximum dispersion measure of 11 000 pc cm$^{-3}$ at which the dispersion delay across the entire bandwidth is equal to the 13 s transit length of our observations. The analysis produced more than 18 million candidates. Machine learning techniques sorted the radio frequency interference and possibly astrophysical candidates, allowing us to visually inspect and confirm the candidate transients. We found no evidence for new astrophysical transients in our data. We also searched for emission from repeated transient signals, but found no evidence for such sources. We detected single pulses from two known pulsars in our observations and their measured flux densities are consistent with the expected values. Based on our observations and sensitivity, we estimated the upper limit for the FRB rate to be $<$2.8$\times10^5$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence of 0.16 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz, which is consistent with the rates from other telescopes and surveys.",astro-ph.HE

We show that, in the case of supermassive black holes situated in active galactic nuclei, the chiral charge density and the chiral chemical potential are very small and unlikely to have any observable effects. In contrast, the chiral asymmetry produced in the magnetospheres of magnetars can be substantial. It can trigger the chiral plasma instability that, in turn, can lead to observable phenomena in magnetars. In particular, the instability should trigger circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation in a wide window of frequencies, spanning from radio to near-infrared. As such, the produced chiral charge has the potential to affect some features of fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Though originally motivated by emission models which invoke a relativistic shock, the model could in principle apply to a wider range of emission scenarios. We quantify the burst's detectability using the frequency bandwidth over which most of its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is accumulated. We demonstrate that by varying just a single parameter of the toy model-the power-law index \beta of the frequency drift rate-one can transform a long (and hence preferentially time-resolved) burst with a narrow time-integrated spectrum into a shorter burst with a broad power-law time-integrated spectrum. We suggest that burst-to-burst diversity in the value of \beta could generate the dichotomy between burst duration and frequency-width recently found by CHIME. In shock models, the value of \beta is related to the radial density profile of external medium, which in light of the preferentially longer duration of bursts from repeating sources may point to diversity in the external environments surrounding repeating versus one-off FRB sources.",astro-ph.HE

About 30 magnetars and magnetar candidates known currently are probably isolated. But the possibility that magnetars are in binaries hasn't been excluded. In this work, we perform spin evolution of neutron stars with different magnetic fields in wind-fed high-mass X-ray binaries and compare the spin period distribution with observations, aiming to find magnetars in binaries. Our simulation shows that some of the neutron stars, which have long spin periods or in wide-separation systems, need strong magnetic fields to explain their spin evolution. This implies that there are probably magnetars in high-mass X-ray binaries. Moreover, this can further provide a theoretical basis for some unclear astronomical phenomena, such as the possible origin of periodic fast radio bursts from magnetars in binary systems.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2110.09440,Bo Han Chen et al.,Uncloaking hidden repeating fast radio bursts with unsupervised machine learning,"The origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), astronomical transients with millisecond timescales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work, we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning, without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognise the FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) database. We found that the unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95 per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474 non-repeater sources.

arXiv:2110.08981,"Can-Min Deng, ",Earth-mass primordial black hole mergers as sources for non-repeating FRBs,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astronomical radio transients with extremely short intrinsic duration. Until now, the physical origins of them still remain elusive especially for the non-repeating FRBs. Strongly inspired by recent progress on possible evidence of Earth-mass primordial black holes, we revisit the model of Earth-mass primordial black holes mergers as sources for non-repeating FRBs. Under the null hypothesis that the observed non-repeating FRBs are originated from the mergers of Earth-mass primordial black holes, we analyzed four independent samples of non-repeating FRBs to study the model parameters i.e. the typical charge value $q_{\rm{c}}$ and the power index $\alpha$ of the charge distribution function of the primordial black hole population $\phi(q) \propto (q/q_{\rm{c}})^{-\alpha}$ which describe how the charge was distributed in the population. $q$ is the charge of   the hole in the unit of $\sqrt{G} M$, where $M$ is the mass of the hole. It turns out that this model can explain the observed data well. {Assuming the monochromatic mass spectrum for primordial black holes}, we get the average value of typical charge $\bar{q}_{\rm{c}}/10^{-5}=1.59^{+0.08}_{-0.18}$ and the power index $\bar{\alpha}=4.53^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ by combining the fitting results given by four non-repeating FRB samples. The event rate of the non-repeating FRBs can be explained in the context of this model, if the abundance of the primordial black hole populations with charge $q \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is larger than $10^{-5}$ which is far below the upper limit given by current observations for the abundance of Earth-mass primordial black holes. In the future, simultaneous detection of FRBs and high frequency gravitational waves produced by mergers of Earth-mass primordial black holes may directly confirm or deny this model.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2110.08435,"Maxim Lyutikov, ",Escape of Fast Radio Bursts from magnetars' magnetospheres,"We discuss dissipative processes occurring during production and escape of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from magnetars' magnetospheres, the presumed loci of FRBs. High magnetic fields are required in the emission region, both to account for the overall energetics of FRBs, and in order to suppress ``normal'' (non-coherent) radiative losses of radio emitting particles; this limits the emission radii to $\leq {\rm few} \times 10 R_{NS}$. Radiative losses by particles in the strong FRB pulse may occur in the outer regions of the magnetosphere for longer rotation periods, $P\geq 1$ second. These losses are suppressed by several effects: (i) the ponderomotive pre-acceleration of background plasma along the direction of wave propagation (losses reduced approximately as $\gamma_\parallel^{3}$: smaller frequency, $ \propto \gamma_\parallel^2$ in power, and times scales stretched, $ \propto \gamma_\parallel$); this acceleration is non-dissipative and is reversed on the declining part of the pulse; (ii) Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effects (long radiation formation length and ensuing destructive interference of scattered waves). In some cases an FRB pulse may be dissipated on external perturbations (e.g., an incoming pulse of Alfven waves): this may produce a pulse of UV/soft X-rays, a swan song of an FRB, possibly detectable by Chandra.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, we consider a special type of microlensing events where the sources are fast radio bursts with $\sim$milliseconds (ms) durations for which the relative motion between the lens and source is negligible. In this scenario, it is possible to temporally resolve the individual microimages. As a result, a method beyond the inverse ray shooting (IRS) method, which only evaluates the total magnification of all microimages, is needed. We therefore implement an algorithm for identifying individual microimages and computing their magnifications and relative time delays. We validate our algorithm by comparing to analytical predictions for a single microlens case and find excellent agreement. We show that the superposition of pulses from individual microimages produces a light curve that appears as multi-peaked FRBs. The relative time delays between pulses can reach 0.1--1 ms for stellar-mass lenses and hence can already be resolved temporally by current facilities. Although not yet discovered, microlensing of FRBs will become regular events and surpass the number of quasar microlensing events in the near future when $10^{4-5}$ FRBs are expected to be discovered on a daily basis. Our algorithm provides a way of generating the microlensing light curve that can be used for constraining stellar mass distribution in distant galaxies.",astro-ph.GA

Li et al.,Long and Short Fast Radio Bursts are Different from Repeating and Non-repeating Transients,"We collect 133 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), including 110 non-repeating and 23 repeating ones, and systematically investigate their observational properties. To check the frequency dependence of FRB classifications, we define our samples with a central frequency below/above 1GHz as subsample I/II. We find that there is a clear bimodal distribution of pulse width for the subsample I. And If we classify FRBs into short FRBs (\emph{s}FRBs) ($<$100 ms) and long FRBs (\emph{l}FRBs) ($>$100 ms) as done for short and long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the \emph{s}FRBs at higher central frequency are commonly shorter than those at lower central frequency not only for non-repeating but also repeating \emph{s}FRBs. Secondly, we find that fluence and peak flux density are correlated with a power law relation of $F \varpropto S{^{\gamma}_{p,obs}}$ for both \emph{s}FRBs and \emph{l}FRBs whose distributions are obviously different. Thirdly, the \emph{l}FRBs with isotropic energies ranging from $10^{42}$ to $10^{44}$ erg are more energetic than the \emph{s}FRBs in the $F- DM_{EX}$ plane, indicating that they are two representative types. Finally, it is interestingly note that the peak flux density behaves an independence on the redshift when the distance of the FRBs becomes far enough, which is similar to the scenario of peak flux evolving with redshift in the field of GRBs. We predict that fainter FRBs at higher redshift of $z>2$ can be successfully detected by FAST and SKA in the near future.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2110.03482,C. G. Bassa et al.,Fourier-domain dedispersion,"We present and implement the concept of the Fourier-domain dedispersion (FDD) algorithm, a brute-force incoherent dedispersion algorithm. This algorithm corrects the frequency-dependent dispersion delays in the arrival time of radio emission from sources such as radio pulsars and fast radio bursts. Where traditional time-domain dedispersion algorithms correct time delays using time shifts, the FDD algorithm performs these shifts by applying phase rotations to the Fourier-transformed time-series data. Incoherent dedispersion to many trial dispersion measures (DMs) is compute, memory-bandwidth and I/O intensive and dedispersion algorithms have been implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to achieve high computational performance. However, time-domain dedispersion algorithms have low arithmetic intensity and are therefore often memory-bandwidth limited. The FDD algorithm avoids this limitation and is compute limited, providing a path to exploit the potential of current and upcoming generations of GPUs. We implement the FDD algorithm as an extension of the DEDISP time-domain dedispersion software. We compare the performance and energy-to-completion of the FDD implementation using an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU against the standard as well as an optimized version of DEDISP. The optimized implementation already provides a factor of 1.5 to 2 speedup at only 66% of the energy utilization compared to the original algorithm. We find that the FDD algorithm outperforms the optimized time-domain dedispersion algorithm by another 20% in performance and 5% in energy-to-completion when a large number of DMs (>=512) are required. The FDD algorithm provides additional performance improvements for FFT-based periodicity surveys of radio pulsars, as the FFT back to the time domain can be omitted.

This enables us to combine the long-term stability and absolute time tagging of the GPS clock with the short and intermediate-term stability of the maser to reduce the clock timing errors between VLBI calibration observations. We validate the system with VLBI-style observations of Cygnus A over a 400 m baseline between CHIME and the CHIME Pathfinder, demonstrating agreement between sky-based and maser-based timing measurements at the 30 ps rms level on timescales ranging from one minute to up to nine days, and meeting the stability requirements for CHIME/FRB Outriggers.

We show that the polarization properties are determined by the ratio of observing bandwidth and coherence bandwidth of the scattering screen and the ratio of temporal resolution of the instrument and the variability time of screen, as long as the length over which the Faraday rotation induced by the screen changes by $\sim\pi$ is smaller than the size of the screen visible to the observer. We describe the conditions under which a source that is 100\% linearly polarized intrinsically might be observed as partially depolarized, and how the source's temporal variability can be distinguished from the temporal variability induced by the scattering screen. In general, linearly polarized waves passing through a magnetized scattering screen can develop a significant circular polarization.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) inject energy into the intergalactic medium, affecting the DM and its scatter. To determine the effectiveness of FRBs as a probe of AGN feedback, we analysed three different AGN models from the EAGLE simulation series. We measured the mean DM-redshift relation, and the scatter around it, using $2.56 \times 10^8$ sightlines at 131 redshift ($z$) bins between $0 \leq z \leq 3$. While the DM-redshift relation itself is highly robust against different AGN feedback models, significant differences are detected in the scatter around the mean: weaker feedback leads to more scatter. We find $\sim 10^4$ localised FRBs are needed to discriminate between the scatter in standard feedback and stronger, more intermittent feedback models. The number of FRBs required is dependent on the redshift distribution of the detected population. A log-normal redshift distribution at $z=0.5$ requires approximately 50% fewer localised FRBs than a distribution centred at $z=1$.

Rodin, ",Comparative Analysis of the Observational Properties of Fast Radio Bursts at the Frequencies of 111 and 1400 MHz,"A comparative analysis of the observational characteristics of fast radio bursts at the frequencies 111 and 1400 MHz is carried out. The distributions of radio bursts by the dispersion measure are constructed. At both frequencies, they are described by a lognormal distribution with the parameters $\mu =6.2$ $\sigma = 0.7$. The dependence $\tau_{sc}(DM)$ of the scattering value on the dispersion measure at 111 MHz and 1400 MHz is also constructed. This dependence is fundamentally different from the dependence for pulsars. A comparative analysis of the relationship between the scattering of pulses and the dispersion measure at 1400 MHz and 111 MHz showed that for both frequencies it has the form $\tau_{sc}(DM)\sim DM^k$, where $k = 0.49 \pm 0.18$ and $k = 0.43 \pm 0.15$ for the frequencies 111 and 1400 MHz, respectively. The obtained dependence is explained within the framework of the assumption of the extragalactic occurrence of fast radio bursts and an almost uniform distribution of matter in intergalactic space. From the dependence $\tau_{sc}(DM)$ a total estimate of the contribution to the matter of the halo of our and the host galaxy to $DM$ is obtained $DM_{halo} + \frac{DM_{host}}{1+z}\approx 60\;{\rm pc/cm}^3$. Based on the LogN - LogS dependence, the average spectral index of radio bursts is derived $\alpha = - 0.63 \pm 0.20$ provided that the statistical properties of these samples at 111 and 1400 MHz are the same.",astro-ph.IM

Targeted monitoring of repeating FRB sources provides the opportunity to fully characterize the emission properties in a manner impossible with one-off bursts. Here, we report observations of the source of FRB 20201124A, with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver at the Parkes 64-m radio telescope (Murriyang). The source entered a period of emitting bright bursts during early 2021 April. We have detected 16 bursts from this source. One of the bursts detected with ASKAP is the brightest burst ever observed from a repeating FRB source with an inferred fluence of $640\pm70$ Jy ms. Of the five bursts detected with the Parkes UWL, none display any emission in the range 1.1--4 GHz. All UWL bursts are highly polarized, with their Faraday rotation measures (RMs) showing apparent variations. We obtain an average RM of $-614$ rad m$^{-2}$ for this FRB source with a standard deviation of $16$ rad m$^{-2}$ in the UWL bursts. In one of the UWL bursts, we see evidence of significant circularly polarized emission with a fractional extent of $47\pm1$ per cent. Such a high degree of circular polarization has never been seen before in bursts from repeating FRB sources. We also see evidence for significant variation in the linear polarization position angle in the pulse profile of this UWL repeat burst. Models for repeat burst emission will need to account for the increasing diversity in the burst polarization properties.",astro-ph.HE

In particular, evidence of a $P=16.35$ day period has been reported for FRB 180916.J0158+65. We seek an explanation within the frame of our orbiting asteroid model, whereby FRBs are produced in the plasma wake of asteroids immersed in the wind of a pulsar or a magnetar. We used the data reported by the CHIME/FRB collaboration in order to infer the orbital characteristics of asteroid swarms, and performed parametric studies to explore the possible characteristics of the pulsar, its wind, and of the asteroids, under the constraint that the latter remain dynamically and thermally stable. We found a plausible configuration in which a young pulsar is orbited by a main $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ companion with a period $3P = 49$d, three times longer than the apparent periodicity $P$. Asteroids responsible for FRBs are located in three dynamical swarms near the L3, L4 and L5 Lagrange points, in a 2:3 orbital resonance akin to the Hildas class of asteroids in the Solar system. In addition, asteroids could be present in the Trojan swarms at the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Together these swarms form a carousel that explains the apparent $P$ periodicity and dispersion. We estimated that the presence of at least a few thousand asteroids, of size $\sim20$km, is necessary to produce the observed burst rate. We show how radius-to-frequency mapping in the wind and small perturbations by turbulence can suffice to explain downward-drifting sub-pulses, micro-structures, and narrow spectral occupancy.",astro-ph.HE

It entered a period of high activity in April of 2021, at which time several observatories recorded tens to hundreds more bursts from the source. These follow-up observations enabled precise localization and host galaxy identification. In this paper, we report on the CHIME/FRB-detected bursts from FRB 20201124A, including their best-fit morphologies, fluences, and arrival times. The large exposure time of the CHIME/FRB telescope to the location of this source allows us to constrain its rates of activity. We analyze the repetition rates over different spans of time, constraining the rate prior to discovery to $< 3.4$ day$^{-1}$ (at 3$\sigma$), and demonstrate significant change in the event rate following initial detection. Lastly, we perform a maximum-likelihood estimation of a power-law luminosity function, finding a best-fit index $\alpha = -4.6 \pm 1.3 \pm 0.6$, with a break at a fluence threshold of $F_{\rm min} \sim 16.6$~Jy~ms, consistent with the fluence completeness limit of the observations.

arXiv:2109.09251,Huan Zhou et al.,Search for lensing signatures from the latest fast radio burst observations and constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes,"The possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) form a part of dark matter has been considered for a long time but poorly constrained over a wide mass range. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond duration. Lensing effect of them has been proposed as one of the cleanest probes for constraining the presence of PBHs in the stellar mass window. In this paper, we first apply the normalised cross-correlation algorithm to search and identify candidates of lensed FRBs in the latest public FRB observations, i.e. $593$ FRBs which mainly consist of the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB catalog, and then derive constraints on the abundance of PBHs from the null search result of lensing signature. For a monochromatic mass distribution, the fraction of dark matter made up of PBHs could be constrained to $\leq87\%$ for $\geq500~M_{\odot}$ at 95\% confidence level by assuming flux ratio thresholds dependent signal-to-noise ratio for each FRB and that apparently one-off events are intrinsic single bursts. This result would be improved by a three times factor when a conventional constant flux ratio threshold is considered. Moreover, we derive constraints on PBHs with a log-normal mass function naturally predicted by some popular inflation models and often investigated with gravitational wave detections. We find that, in this mass distribution scenario, the constraint from currently public FRB observations is relatively weaker than the one from gravitational wave detections. It is foreseen that upcoming complementary multi-messenger observations will yield considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs in this intriguing mass window.",astro-ph.CO

Based on observations at two widely separated frequencies, 55 MHz (NenuFAR) and 1.4 GHz (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope), we review the properties of these single pulses. We conclude that they are more similar to ordinary pulses of radio emission than to a special kind of short and bright Giant Pulses, observed from only a handful of pulsars. We argue that temporal variation of properties of interstellar medium along the line of sight to this nearby pulsar, namely the fluctuating size of decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillation makes important contribution to observed single-pulse fluence variability. We further present interesting structures in the low-frequency single-pulse spectra that resemble the ""sad trombones"" seen in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs); although for PSR B0950+08 the upward frequency drift is also routinely present. We explain these spectral features with radius-to-frequency mapping, similar to the model developed by Wang et al. (2019) for FRBs. Finally, we speculate that microsecond-scale fluence variability of the general pulsar population remains poorly known, and that its further study may bring important clues about the nature of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

The discovery of FRB 20200120E in association with a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, however, casts doubts on such an assumption. We apply the Monte Carlo method developed in a previous work to test different FRB redshift distribution models against the recently released first CHIME FRB catalog in terms of their distributions in specific fluence, external dispersion measure ($\rm DM_E$), and inferred isotropic energy. Our results clearly rule out the hypothesis that all FRBs track the star formation history of the universe. The hypothesis that all FRBs track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but still cannot meet both the $\rm DM_E$ and the energy criteria.

The recent detection of a MGF at GeV energies by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) motivated the search for GeV counterparts to the >100 currently known FRBs. Taking advantage of more than 12 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we perform a search for gamma-ray emission from all the reported repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We analyse on different-time scales the \textit{Fermi}-LAT data of each individual source separately, including a cumulative analysis on the repeating ones. In addition, we perform the first stacking analysis at GeV energies of this class of sources in order to constrain the gamma-ray properties of the FRBs that are undetected at high energies. The stacking analysis is a powerful method that allow a possible detection from below-threshold FRBs providing important information on these objects.

Their nature is still widely debated. I provide the first analysis of atomic gas properties of a small sample of FRB hosts to constrain their nature. HI observations exist for NGC 3252, the host of FRB 181030A, M81, the host of FRB 200120E, and the Milky Way, the host of FRB 200428. I report three observables: i) all three FRB hosts are interacting galaxies; ii) the Hi spectra of both FRB hosts with such data available are highly asymmetric, several standard deviations above the general population of galaxies; iii) two FRB hosts have normal atomic gas properties and one is strongly deficient in atomic gas. This indicates that nearby and repeating FRBs are connected with a recent enhancement of star formation due to interaction. This supports fast FRB channels, for example a massive star with a short delay time so that interaction signatures giving rise to the birth of the progenitor are still visible. Long gamma-ray burst (GRB) and broad-lined type Ic supernova (SN) hosts exhibit much more symmetric spectra, even though they were claimed to experience gas inflow from the intergalactic medium. The difference can be explained by the interactions experienced by FRB hosts being more disruptive than these gas inflows, or by the mass effect, with GRB/SN hosts at lower masses having less organized gas motions, so with HI lines closer to a symmetrical Gaussian. This also suggests that the emission mechanisms of FRBs and GRBs are different.",astro-ph.HE

We demonstrate that the requirement of conservation of the magnetic flux dominates the overall dynamics of magnetic explosions. This is missed in conventional hydrodynamic models of the ejections as expanding shell with parametrically added magnetic field, as well as one-dimensional models of magnetic disturbances. Most of the initial free energy of an explosion is actually spent on stretching its own internal magnetic field, while doing minimal $pdV$ work against the surrounding. Magnetic explosions from magnetars come into force balance with the pre-flares wind close to the light cylinder. They are then advected quietly with the wind, or propagate as electromagnetic disturbances. No powerful shock waves are generated in the wind.",astro-ph.HE

Recent works proposed to use such strongly-lensed FRBs to derive constraints on the current expansion rate $ H_{0} $ as well as on cosmic curvature. Here we study the prospects for placing constraints on departures from general relativity via such systems. Using an ensemble of simulated events, we focus on the gravitational slip parameter $\gamma_{\rm PN}$ in screened modified gravity models and show that FRB time-delay measurements can yield constraints as tight as $ \left| \gamma_{\rm PN}-1\right| \lesssim 0.04\times(\Lambda/100\rm kpc)\times[N/10]^{-1/2} $ at $1\sigma$ with $10$ detections.",astro-ph.CO

In this paper, we show that incorporating wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey data in the foreground of localized FRBs can significantly improve constraints on the partition of diffuse cosmic baryons. Using mock DMs and realistic lightcone galaxy catalogs derived from the Millennium simulation, we define spectroscopic surveys that can be carried out with 4m and 8m-class wide field spectroscopic facilities. On these simulated surveys, we carry out Bayesian density reconstructions in order to estimate the foreground matter density field. In comparison with the `true' matter density field, we show that these can help reduce the uncertainties in the foreground structures by $\sim 2-3\times$ compared to cosmic variance. We calculate the Fisher matrix to forecast that $N=30\: (96)$ localized FRBs should be able to constrain the diffuse cosmic baryon fraction to $\sim 10\%\: (\sim 5\%) $, and parameters governing the size and baryon fraction of galaxy circumgalactic halos to within $\sim 20-25\%\: (\sim 8-12\%)$. From the Fisher analysis, we show that the foreground data increases the sensitivity of localized FRBs toward our parameters of interest by $\sim 25\times$.

With a halo-model approach, we predict that the cross-correlation with cluster-sized haloes is less affected by the details of gastrophysics, providing robust cosmological information. For less massive haloes, the cross-correlation at angular scales of $<10\, \mathrm{arcmin}$ is sensitive to gas expelled from the halo centre due to galactic feedback. Assuming $20000$ FRBs over $20000 \, {\rm deg}^2$ with a localisation error being 3 arcmin, we expect that the cross-correlation signal at halo masses of $10^{12}-10^{14}\, M_\odot$ can be measured with a level of $\sim 1\%$ precision in a redshift range of $0<z<1$. Such precise measurements enable one to put a 1.5\% level constraint on $\sigma_8\, (\Omega_\mathrm{M}/0.3)^{0.5}$ and a 3\% level constraint on $(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/0.049)(h/0.67)(f_\mathrm{e}/0.95)$ ($\sigma_8$, $\Omega_\mathrm{M}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, $h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$ are the linear mass variance smoothed at $8\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, mean mass density, mean baryon density, the present-day Hubble parameter and fraction of free electrons in cosmic baryons today), whereas the gas-to-halo mass relation in galaxies and clusters can be constrained with a level of $10\%-20\%$. Furthermore the cross-correlation analyses can break the degeneracy among $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, $h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$, inherent in the DM-redshift relation. Our proposal opens new possibilities for FRB cosmology, while it requires extensive galaxy redshift catalogues and further improvement of the halo model.",astro-ph.CO

Within the FRB localization region, we identify NGC 3252 as the most promising host, with an estimated chance coincidence probability $< 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$. Moreover, we do not find any other galaxy with M$_{r} < -15$ AB mag within the localization region to the maximum estimated FRB redshift of 0.05. This rules out a dwarf host 5 times less luminous than any FRB host discovered to date. NGC 3252 is a star-forming spiral galaxy, and at a distance of $\approx$ 20 Mpc, it is one of the closest FRB hosts discovered thus far. From our archival radio data search, we estimate a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the luminosity of a persistent compact radio source (source size $<$ 0.3 kpc at 20 Mpc) at 3 GHz to be ${\rm 2 \times 10^{26} erg~s^{-1} Hz^{-1}}$, at least 1500 times smaller than that of the FRB 20121102A persistent radio source.

The associated globular cluster has an age of $\sim9.13~{\rm Gyr}$, and hosts an old population of stars. In this work, we consider that an FRB source is in a close binary system with a low-mass main sequence star as its companion. Due to the large burst energy of the FRB, when the companion star stops the FRB, its surface would be heated by the radiation-induced shock, and make re-emission. For a binary system with a solar-like companion star and an orbital period of a few days, we find that the re-emission is mainly at optical band, and with delays of a few seconds after the FRB. Its luminosity is several times larger than the solar luminosity, and the duration is about hundreds of seconds.

In this work, we aim to estimate the contribution to FRB 180924 DM from foreground galactic halos. Localized by ASKAP to a massive galaxy, this sightline is notable for an estimated cosmic web contribution to the DM ($\rm DM_{cosmic} = 220~pc~cm^{-3}$), which is less than the average value at the host redshift ($\rm z = 0.3216$) estimated from the Macquart relation ($280~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$). In the favored models of the cosmic web, this suggests few intersections with foreground halos at small impact parameters ($\lesssim 100$ kpc). To test this hypothesis, we carried out spectroscopic observations of the field galaxies within $\sim$1' of the sightline with VLT/MUSE and Keck/LRIS. Furthermore, we developed a probabilistic methodology that leverages photometric redshifts derived from wide-field DES and WISE imaging. We conclude that there is no galactic halo that closely intersects the sightline and also that the net DM contribution from halos, $\rm DM_{halos}< 45~pc~cm^{-3}$ (95 % c.l.). This value is lower than the $\rm DM_{halos}$ estimated from an ""average"" sightline ($121~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$) using the Planck $\Lambda CDM$ model and the Aemulus halo mass function and reasonably explains its low $\rm DM_{cosmic}$ value. We conclude that FRB 180924 represents the predicted majority of sightlines in the universe with no proximate foreground galactic halos.

In both models, the radio emission of FRB 180916 is produced by a precessing jet. For the first disk-driven jet precession model, an extremely low viscous parameter (i.e., the dimensionless viscosity parameter $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-8}$) is required to explain the precession of FRB 180916, which implies its implausibility. For the second tidal force-driven jet precession model, we consider a compact binary consists of a neutron star/black hole and a white dwarf; the white dwarf fills its Roche lobe and mass transfer occurs. Due to the misalignment between the disk and orbital plane, the tidal force of the white dwarf can drive jet precession. We show that the relevant precession periods are several days to hundreds of days, depending on the specific accretion rates and component masses. The duration of FRB 180916 generation in the binary with extremely high accretion rate will be several thousand years.",astro-ph.HE

In this region, the magnetospheric particles have a huge cross section for scattering the wave. As a result, the wave strongly interacts with the magnetosphere and compresses it, depositing the FRB energy into the compressed field and the scattered radiation. The scattered spectrum extends to the $\gamma$-ray band and triggers $e^\pm$ avalanche, further boosting the opacity. These processes choke FRBs, disfavoring scenarios with a radio source confined at $R\ll 10^{10}\,$cm.

Wijers, ",Coherent curvature radiation: maximum luminosity and high-energy emission,"High brightness temperature radio transients such as pulsars and fast radio bursts require the coherent radiation of particles. The antenna class of coherent radiation models require a large number of charged particles radiating in phase, therefore the particles must be spatially confined and have well-aligned velocities. Given these necessary conditions, we look at the magnetic field induced by the currents associated with coherently emitting accelerated particles and consider the interaction between the radiating particles and the induced magnetic field. We find a maximum luminosity of coherent curvature radiation that depends on source parameters such as surface magnetic field and neutron star spin period. We find that coherent radio emission across all luminosities can be explained by coherent curvature radiation and suggest it could be universally responsible for both FRBs and extreme galactic sources. Using the Crab Pulsar as an example, we constrain the emission parameters and origin of the most extreme nanoshots to within 60km of the pulsar surface assuming coherent curvature radiation. In agreement with recent observations, we also predict simultaneous X-ray emission from small-scale particle gyration due to the induced field.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2108.06931,L. P. Xin et al.,Constrains on optical emission of FAST-detected FRB 20181130B with GWAC synchronized observations,"Multi-wavelength simultaneous observations are essential to the constraints on the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, it is a significant observational challenge due to the nature of FRBs as transients with a radio millisecond duration, which occur randomly in the sky regardless of time and position. Here, we report the search for short-time fast optical bursts in the GWAC archived data associated with FRB 20181130B, which were detected by the Five Hundred Meter Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and recently reported. No new credible sources were detected in all single GWAC images with an exposure time of 10 s, including image with coverage of the expected arrival time in optical wavelength by taking the high dispersion measurements into account. Our results provide a limiting magnitude of 15.43$\pm0.04$ mag in R band, corresponding to a flux density of 1.66 Jy or 8.35 mag in AB system by assuming that the duration of the optical band is similar to that of the radio band of about 10 ms. This limiting magnitude makes the spectral index of $\alpha<0.367$ from optical to radio wavelength. The possible existence of longer duration optical emission was also investigated with an upper limits of 0.33 Jy (10.10 mag), 1.74 mJy (15.80 mag) and 0.16 mJy (18.39 mag) for the duration of 50 ms, 10 s and 6060 s, respectively. This undetected scenario could be partially attributed to the shallow detection capability, as well as the high inferred distance of FRB 20181130B and the low fluence in radio wavelength. The future detectability of optical flashes associated with nearby and bright FRBs are also discussed in this paper.",astro-ph.HE

This problem is examined by solving the particle motion in the wave. Remarkably, waves with amplitudes $E_0>B_{bg}$ pump particle energy via repeating resonance events, quickly reaching the radiation reaction limit. As a result, the wave is scattered with a huge cross section. This fact has implications for models of fast radio bursts and magnetars.

Unusual for radio magnetars, the Galactic Center (GC) magnetar $\rm PSR~J1745-2900$ has been continually active since its discovery in 2013. We monitored the GC magnetar at $\rm 4-8~GHz$ for 6 hours in August$-$September 2019 using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. During our observations, the GC magnetar emitted a flat fluence spectrum over $\rm 5-8~GHz$ to within $2\sigma$ uncertainty. From our data, we estimate a $\rm 6.4~GHz$ period-averaged flux density, $\overline{S}_{6.4} \approx (240 \pm 5)~\mu$Jy. Tracking the temporal evolution of $\overline{S}_{6.4}$, we infer a gradual weakening of GC magnetar activity during $2016-2019$ relative to that between $2013-2015.5$. Typical single pulses detected in our study reveal marginally resolved sub-pulses with opposing spectral indices, a feature characteristic of radio magnetars but unseen in rotation-powered pulsars. However, unlike in fast radio bursts, these sub-pulses exhibit no perceptible radio frequency drifts.

In this analysis, we show that banded emission of FRBs can lead to incompleteness across the observing band. This biases the detected sample of bursts and can explain the various shapes of cumulative energy distributions seen for repeating FRBs. We assume a Gaussian shape of the burst spectra and used simulations to demonstrate the above bias using an FRB 121102-like example. We recovered energy distributions that showed a break in power-law and flattening of power-law at low energies, based on the fluence threshold of the observations. We provide recommendations for single-pulse searches and analysis of repeating FRBs to account for this incompleteness. Primarily, we recommend that burst spectra should be modeled to estimate the intrinsic fluence and bandwidth of the burst robustly. Also, bursts that lie mainly within the observing band should be used for analyses of energy distributions. We show that the bimodality reported in the distribution of energies of FRB 121102 by Li et al. (2021) disappears when burst bandwidth, instead of the center frequency of the observation, is used to estimate energy. Sub-banded searches will also aid in detecting band-limited bursts.

arXiv:2108.04127,Xing-Wei Qiu et al.,A forecast of using fast radio burst observations to constrain holographic dark energy,"Recently, about five hundred fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by CHIME/FRB Project have been reported. The vast amounts of data would make FRBs a promising low-redshift cosmological probe in the forthcoming years, and thus the issue of how many FRBs are needed for precise cosmological parameter estimation in different dark energy models should be detailedly investigated. Different from the usually considered $w(z)$-parameterized models in the literature, in this work we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model and the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model, which originate from the holographic principle of quantum gravity, using the simulated localized FRB data as a cosmological probe for the first time. We show that the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be constrained to about 2% precision in the HDE model with the Macquart relation of FRB by using 10000 accurately-localized FRBs combined with the current CMB data, which is similar to the precision of the SH0ES value. Using 10000 localized FRBs combined with the CMB data can achieve about 6% constraint on the dark-energy parameter $c$ in the HDE model, which is tighter than the current BAO data combined with CMB. We also study the combination of the FRB data and another low-redshift cosmological probe, i.e. gravitational wave (GW) standard siren data, with the purpose of measuring cosmological parameters independent of CMB. Although the parameter degeneracies inherent in FRB and in GW are rather different, we find that more than 10000 FRBs are demanded to effectively improve the constraints in the holographic dark energy models.",astro-ph.CO

For the time being a number of extragalactic FRBs have been detected in the high-frequency radio band including repeating ones. The most plausible explanation for these phenomena is magnetar hyperflares. The first observational evidence of this scenario was obtained in April 2020 when an FRB was detected from the direction of the Galactic magnetar and soft gamma repeater SGR1935+2154. The FRB was preceded with a number of soft gamma-ray bursts observed by Swift-BAT satellite, which triggered the follow-up program of the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). H.E.S.S. has observed SGR1935+2154 over a 2 hour window few hours prior to the FRB detection by STARE2 and CHIME. The observations overlapped with other X-ray bursts from the magnetar detected by INTEGRAL and Swift-BAT, thus providing first observations of a magnetar in a flaring state in the very-high energy domain.

In addition, the probability density functions of fluctuations of duration, waiting time, fluence and flux well follow the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian distribution. The $q$ values keep steady for different temporal scale intervals, indicating a scale-invariant structure of the bursts.

FRB20180301A was detected and localized with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to a star-forming galaxy at $z=0.3304$. FRB20191228A, and FRB20200906A were detected and localized by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder to host galaxies at $z=0.2430$ and $z=0.3688$, respectively. We combine these with 13 other well-localized FRBs in the literature, and analyze the host galaxy properties. We find no significant differences in the host properties of repeating and apparently non-repeating FRBs. FRB hosts are moderately star-forming, with masses slightly offset from the star-forming main-sequence. Star formation and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) emission are major sources of ionization in FRB host galaxies, with the former dominant in repeating FRB hosts. FRB hosts do not track stellar mass and star formation as seen in field galaxies (more than 95% confidence). FRBs are rare in massive red galaxies, suggesting that progenitor formation channels are not solely dominated by delayed channels which lag star formation by Gigayears. The global properties of FRB hosts are indistinguishable from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) hosts, and the spatial offset (from galaxy centers) of FRBs is mostly inconsistent with that of the Galactic neutron star population (95% confidence). The spatial offsets of FRBs (normalized to the galaxy effective radius) also differ from those of globular clusters (GCs) in late- and early-type galaxies with 95% confidence.",astro-ph.HE

The IGM and galaxy halos contribute significantly to dispersion measures but evidently not to scattering, which is then dominated by host galaxies. This enables usage of scattering times for estimating DM contributions from host galaxies and also for a combined scattering-dispersion redshift estimator. Redshift estimation is calibrated using scattering of Galactic pulsars after taking into account different scattering geometries for Galactic and intergalactic lines of sight. The DM-only estimator has a bias $\sim 0.1$ and RMS error $\sim 0.15$ in the redshift estimate for an assumed ad-hoc value of 50 pc cm$^{-3}$ for the host galaxy's DM contribution. The combined redshift estimator shows less bias by a factor of four to ten and a 20 to 40% smaller RMS error. We find that values for the baryonic fraction of the ionized IGM $f_{\rm igm} \sim 0.85 \pm 0.05$ optimize redshift estimation using dispersion and scattering.

These observations in the incoherent array mode simultaneously provided an arcsecond localization of bursts from \rss, the discovery of persistent radio emission associated with the host galaxy, and the detection of 48 bursts. Using the brightest burst in the sample ($F= 108~{\rm Jy~ms}$) we find a structure-maximizing dispersion measure of $410.8 \pm 0.5~{\rm pc~cm}^{-3}$. We find that our observations are complete down to a fluence level of $10~{\rm Jy~ms}$, above which the cumulative burst rate scales as a power-law $R(>\!F) = 10~{\rm hr}^{-1} \left(F/10\mathrm{~Jy~ms}\right)^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = -1.2 \pm 0.2$. We find that the bursts are on average wider than those reported for other repeating FRBs. We find that the waiting time between bursts is well approximated by an exponential distribution with a mean of $\sim 2.9$ min during our observations. We searched for periodicities using both a standard Fourier domain method and the Fast Folding Algorithm, but found no significant candidates. We measure bulk spectro-temporal drift rates between $-0.75$ and $-20~{\rm MHz~ms}^{-1}$. Finally, we use the brightest burst to set an upper limit to the scattering time of 11.1~ms at 550~MHz.

However, the $\Lambda$CDM model is challenged by Hubble tension, a remarkable difference of Hubble constant $H_0$ between measurements from local probe and the prediction from Planck cosmic microwave background observations under $ \Lambda$CDM model. So one urgently needs new distance indicators to test the Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration pulses occurring at cosmological distances, which are attractive cosmological probes. However, there is a thorny problem that the dispersion measures (DMs) contributed by host galaxy and the inhomogeneities of intergalactic medium cannot be exactly determined from observations. Previous works assuming fixed values for them bring uncontrolled systematic error in analysis. A reasonable approach is to handle them as probability distributions extracted from cosmological simulations.

In this Letter, we propose that a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) system, which is composed of a neutron star (NS) and a Be star with a circumstellar disk, might be the source of a repeating FRB with periodic activities, and apply this model to explain the activity window of FRB 180916B. The interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the accreted material results in evolution of the spin period and the centrifugal force of the NS, leading to the change of the stress in the NS crust. When the stress of the crust reaches the critical value, a starquake occurs and further produces FRBs. The interval between starquakes is estimated to be a few days that is smaller than the active window of FRB 180916B. When the NS moves out of the disk of the Be star, the interval between starquakes becomes much longer than the orbital period, which corresponds to the non-active phase. In this model, due to the absorption of the disk of the Be star, a frequency-dependent active window would appear for the FRBs, which is consistent with the observed properties of FRB 180916B. And the contribution of dispersion measure (DM) from the disk of the Be star is small. In addition, the location of FRB 180916B in the host galaxy is consistent with a BeXRB system.",astro-ph.HE

Main et al.,Scintillation timescale measurement of the highly active FRB20201124A,"Scintillation of compact radio sources results from the interference between images caused by multipath propagation, and probes the intervening scattering plasma and the velocities of the emitting source and scattering screen. In FRB20201124A, a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) which entered a period of extreme activity, we obtained many burst detections in observations at the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Effelsberg 100\,m Radio Telescope. Bursts nearby in time show similar scintillation patterns, and we measure a scintillation timescale of $14.3\pm1.2$\,min and $7\pm2$\,min at Effelsberg (1370\,MHz) and uGMRT (650\,MHz), respectively, by correlating burst pair spectra. The scintillation bandwidth scaled to 1\,GHz is $0.5\pm0.1$\,MHz, and the inferred scintillation velocity at Effelsberg is $V_{\mathrm{ISS}}\approx (59\pm7) \sqrt{d_{l}/2\,\rm{kpc}}~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$, higher than Earth's velocity for any screen beyond a lens distance of $d_{l} \gtrsim 400\,$pc. From the measured scintillation bandwidth, FRB20201124A has comparatively lower scattering than nearby pulsars, and is underscattered by a factor of $\sim 30$ or $\sim 1200$ compared to the NE2001 and YMW16 model predictions respectively. This underscattering, together with the measured scintillation velocity are consistent with a scattering screen more nearby the Earth at $d_{l} \sim 400\,$pc, rather than at the 2\,kpc spiral arm which NE2001 predicts to be the dominant source of scattering. With future measurements, the distance, geometry, and velocity of the scattering screen could be obtained through modelling of the annual variation in $V_{\rm ISS}$, or through inter-station time delays or interferometric observations.

Piro et al.,The Fast Radio Burst FRB 20201124A in a star forming region: constraints to the progenitor and multiwavelength counterparts,"We present the results of a multiwavelength campaign of FRB 20201124A, the third closest repeating fast radio burst recently localized in a nearby (z=0.0978) galaxy. Deep VLA observations led to the detection of quiescent radio emission, also marginally visible in X-rays with Chandra. Imaging at 22 GHz allowed us to resolve the source on a scale of $\gtrsim$ 1 arcsec and locate it at the position of the FRB, within an error of 0.2 arcsec. EVN and e-MERLIN observations sampled small angular scales, from 2 to 100 mas, providing tight upper limits on the presence of a compact source and evidence for diffuse radio emission. We argue that this emission is associated with enhanced star formation activity in the proximity of the FRB, corresponding to a star formation rate of $\approx 10\ {\rm M}_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$. The surface star formation rate at the location of FRB 20201124A is two orders of magnitude larger than typically observed in other precisely localized FRBs. Such a high SFR is indicative of this FRB source being a new-born magnetar produced from a SN explosion of a massive star progenitor.

In this article we, for the first time, apply a model-independent approach to measure reionization from synthetic FRB data assuming these signals are detected beyond redshift 5. This method allows us to constrain the full shape of the reionization history as well as the CMB optical depth $\tau$ while avoiding the problems of commonly used model-based techniques. 100 localized FRBs, originating from redshifts 5-15, could constrain (at 68% confidence level) the CMB optical depth to within 11%, and the midpoint of reionization to 4%, surpassing current state-of-the-art CMB bounds and quasar limits. Owing to the higher numbers of expected FRBs at lower redshifts, the $\tau$ constraints are asymmetric (+14%, -7%) providing a much stronger lower limit. Finally, we show that the independent constraints on reionization from FRBs will improve limits on other cosmological parameters such as the amplitude of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations.",astro-ph.CO

Inspired by this idea, we present order of magnitude calculations to the scenarios proposed. FRB models such as global starquakes, crust fractures and collisions between pulsars and asteroids/comets are discussed. For each mechanism, the maximum glitch sizes are constrained by the isotropic energy release during the X-ray burst and/or the SGR J1935+2154-like radio burst rate. Brief calculations show that, the maximum glitch sizes for different mechanisms differ by order(s) of magnitude. If glitches are detected to be coincident with FRBs from galactic magnetars in the future, glitch behaviors (such as glitch size, rise timescale, the recovery coefficient and spin down rate offset) are promising to serve as criterions to distinguish glitch mechanisms and in turn to constrain FRB models.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2107.13692,"Liam Connor, Vikram Ravi, ",The observed impact of galaxy halo gas on fast radio bursts,"Galaxies and groups of galaxies exist in dark-matter halos filled with diffuse gas.

Here we analyze the impact of diffuse gas associated with nearby galaxies using the dispersion measures (DMs) of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs). FRB DMs provide direct measurements of the total ionized-gas contents along their sightlines. Out of a sample of 474 distant FRBs from the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1(3), we identify a subset of events that likely intersect the dark-matter halos of galaxies in the local Universe ($<40$\,Mpc). The mean DM of the galaxy-intersecting FRBs is larger than the non-intersecting DMs with probability $>0.99$ and the excess DM is $>90$\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$ with $>95\%$ confidence. The excess is larger than expected for the diffuse gas surrounding isolated galaxies, but may be explained by additional contributions from gas surrounding galaxy groups, including from the Local Group.

The screen imprints temporally sharp but broadband structure on the pulse that has already been dispersed, and the `structure-maximising' bulk of the dispersion measure is acquired further along the path to observer. If so, scaling of the drift rate of repeating FRBs with frequency suggests that the emission is beamed -- out of our line of sight -- with the circum-burst plasma deflecting the beam towards us. This in turn explains the observed limited, variable bandwidths of bursts despite broadband nature of the underlying emission. We summarise the geometric constraints on this simple model delivering much of the observed FRB spectro-temporal phenomenology, present generic predictions and discuss possible nature of modulation.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2107.12989,"Esha Kundu, Bing Zhang, ",Free-free absorption in hot relativistic flows: application to fast radio bursts,"Magnetic flares create hot relativistic shocks outside the light cylinder radius of a magnetised star. Radio emission produced in such a shock or at a radius smaller than the shock undergoes free-free absorption while passing through the shocked medium. In this work, we demonstrate that this free-free absorption can lead to a negative drift in the frequency-time spectra. Whether it is related to the downward drift pattern observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs) is unclear. However, if the FRB down drifting is due to this mechanism then it will be pronounced in those shocks that have isotropic kinetic energies $\gtrsim10^{44}$ erg. In this model, for an internal shock with a Lorentz factor $\sim100$, the normalised drift rate $|{\rm DR_{\rm obs}}|/\nu_{\rm mean}$ is $\sim10^{-2}$ per ms, where $\nu_{\rm mean}$ is the central frequency of the radio pulses. The corresponding radius of the shocked shell is, therefore, in the range of $10^{10}$ cm and $10^{11}$ cm. This implies that, for an outflow consisting of hydrogen ion, the upper limit on the mass of the relativistic shocks is a few $\times~10^{-10}~M_\odot$, which is considerably low compared to that ejected from SGR 1806-20 during the 2004 outburst.",astro-ph.HE

We consider the constraints on internal magnetic fields and geometry if the cyclical behavior observed for FRB~180916.J0158 and FRB 121102 is due to precession of magnetars. In order to frustrate vortex line pinning we argue that internal magnetic fields must be stronger than about $10^{16}$ Gauss, which is large enough to prevent superconductivity in the core and destroy the crustal lattice structure. We conjecture that the magnetic field inside precessing magnetars has three components, (1) a dipole component with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{14}$ Gauss; (2) a toroidal component with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}$ Gauss which only occupies a modest fraction of the stellar volume; and (3) a disordered field with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{16}$ Gauss. The disordered field is primarily responsible for permitting precession, which stops once this field component decays away, which we conjecture happens after $\sim 1000$ years. Conceivably, as the disordered component damps bursting activity diminishes and eventually ceases. We model the quadrupolar magnetic distortion of the star, which is due to its ordered components primarily, as triaxial and very likely prolate. We address the question of whether or not the spin frequency ought to be detectable for precessing, bursting magnetars by constructing a specific model in which bursts happen randomly in time with random directions distributed in or between cones relative to a single symmetry axis. Within the context of these specific models, we find that there are precession geometries for which detecting the spin frequency is very unlikely.",astro-ph.HE

Both phenomena can be accounted for by a young, highly magnetized, precessing neutron star that emits beamed radiation with significant imposed phase jitter. Sporadic narrow-beam emission into an overall wide solid angle can account for the necessary phase jitter, but the slow periodicities with 25 to 55 % duty cycles constrain beam traversals to be significantly smaller. Instead, phase jitter may result from variable emission altitudes that yield large retardation and aberration delays. A detailed arrival-time analysis for triaxial precession includes wobble of the radio beam and the likely larger, cyclical torque resulting from the changes in the spin-magnetic moment angle. These effects will confound identification of the fast periodicity in sparse data sets longer than about a quarter of a precession cycle unless fitted for and removed as with orbital fitting. Stochastic spin noise, likely to be much larger than in radio pulsars, may hinder detection of any fast-periodicity in data spans longer than a few days. These decoherence effects will dissipate as FRB sources age, so they may evolve into objects with properties similar to Galactic magnetars.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2107.12605,Jun-Jie Wei et al.,Similar Scale-invariant Behaviors between Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters and An Extreme Epoch from FRB 121102,"The recent discovery of a Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) associated with a hard X-ray burst from the soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) J1935+2154 has established the magnetar origin of at least some FRBs. In this work, we study the statistical properties of soft gamma-/hard X-ray bursts from SGRs 1806--20 and J1935+2154 and of radio bursts from the repeating FRB 121102. For SGRs, we show that the probability density functions for the differences of fluences, fluxes, and durations at different times have fat tails with a $q$-Gaussian form. The $q$ values in the $q$-Gaussian distributions are approximately steady and independent of the temporal interval scale adopted, implying a scale-invariant structure of SGRs. These features indicate that SGR bursts may be governed by a self-organizing criticality (SOC) process, confirming previous findings. Very recently, 1652 independent bursts from FRB 121102 have been detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Here we also investigate the scale-invariant structure of FRB 121102 based on the latest observations of FAST, and show that FRB 121102 and SGRs share similar statistical properties. Given the bimodal energy distribution of FRB 121102 bursts, we separately explore the scale-invariant behaviors of low- and high-energy bursts of FRB 121102. We find that the $q$ values of low- and high-energy bursts are different, which further strengthens the evidence of the bimodality of the energy distribution. Scale invariance in both the high-energy component of FRB 121102 and SGRs can be well explained within the same physical framework of fractal-diffusive SOC systems.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2107.11557,G. Q. Zhang et al.,Energy and waiting time distributions of FRB 121102 observed by FAST,"The energy and waiting time distributions are important properties for understanding the physical mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Recently, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) detected the largest burst sample of FRB 121102, containing 1652 bursts. We use this sample to investigate the energy and waiting time distributions. The energy count distribution $dN/dE$ at the high-energy range ($>10^{38}$ erg) can be fitted with a single power-law function with an index of $-1.86 ^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, while the distribution at the low-energy range deviates from the power-law function. An interesting result of Li et al. (2021) is that there is an apparent temporal gap between early bursts (occurring before MJD 58740) and late bursts (occurring after MJD 58740). We find the energy distributions of high-energy bursts at different epochs are inconsistent. The power-law index is $-1.70^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ for early bursts and $-2.60^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ for late bursts. For bursts observed in a single day, a linear repetition pattern is found. We use the Weibull function to fit the distribution of waiting time of consecutive bursts. The shape parameter $k = 0.72^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and the event rate $r = 736.43^{+26.55}_{-28.90}$ day$ ^{-1} $ are derived. If the waiting times with $\delta_t < 28$ s are excluded, the burst behavior can be described by a Poisson process. The best-fitting values of $k$ are slightly different for low-energy ($E < 1.58\times10^{38}$ erg) and high-energy ($E > 1.58\times10^{38}$ erg) bursts.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2107.11334,"Dana Simard, Vikram Ravi, ",Measuring interstellar turbulence in fast radio burst host galaxies,"Turbulence is a vital part of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, contributing significantly to galaxy energy budgets and acting as a regulator of star formation. Despite this, little is understood about ISM turbulence empirically. In the Milky Way, multiple tracers are used to reconstruct the density- and velocity-fluctuation power spectra over an enormous range of scales, but questions remain on the nature of these fluctuations at the smallest scales. Even less is known about the ISM of distant galaxies, where only a few tracers of turbulence, such as non-thermal broadening of optical recombination lines, are accessible. We explore the use of radio-wave scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to add a second probe of turbulence in extragalactic galaxies on scales many orders of magnitude smaller than those probed by emission-line widths. We first develop the formalism to compare the scattering measures of FRBs to alternative probes of density and velocity fluctuations in the host-galaxy ISM. We then apply this formalism to three FRBs with detailed host-galaxy analyses in the literature, with the primary motivation of determining whether FRB scattering within the host galaxy probes the same turbulent cascade as the gas seen in H${\rm \alpha}$ emission. In all cases we consider, we find such an association plausible, although in one of these sources, FRB 20121102A, the radio-scattering limit on the turbulent energy is much less constraining than the H${\rm \alpha}$ line width. We anticipate that future FRB surveys, especially those at frequencies below 1 GHz, will find many FRBs that illuminate the small-scale properties of extragalactic ISM.",astro-ph.GA

We simulate intrinsic properties and propagation effects for a variety of FRB population models and compare the simulated distributions of dispersion measures (DMs) and scattering timescales with the corresponding distributions from the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our simulations confirm the results of previous population studies, which suggested that the interstellar medium of the host galaxy alone (simulated based on the NE2001 model) cannot explain the observed scattering timescales of FRBs. We therefore consider additional sources of scattering, namely, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of intervening galaxies and the circumburst medium whose properties are modeled based on typical Galactic plane environments. We find that a population of FRBs with scattering contributed by these media is marginally consistent with the CHIME/FRB catalog. In this scenario, our simulations favor a population of FRBs offset from their galaxy centers over a population which is distributed along the spiral arms. However, if the models proposing the CGM as a source of intense scattering are incorrect, then we conclude that FRBs may inhabit environments with more extreme properties than those inferred for pulsars in the Milky Way.",astro-ph.HE

Lorimer, ",Fast radio bursts at the dawn of the 2020s,"Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the subject we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs -- 60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.",astro-ph.HE

Motivated by rapid technological advancements in recent years, we conducted $\rm \simeq 10~hours$ of L-band ($\rm 1.15-1.75~GHz$) observations of the core of M87 with the Arecibo radio telescope in 2019. Adopting a matched filtering approach, we searched our data for single pulses using trial dispersion measures up to $\rm 5500~pc~cm^{-3}$ and burst durations between $\rm 0.3-123~ms$. We find no evidence of astrophysical bursts in our data above a 7$\sigma$ detection threshold. Our observations thus constrain the burst rate from M87 to $\rm \lesssim 0.1~bursts~hr^{-1}$ above $\rm 1.4~Jy~ms$, the most stringent upper limit obtained to date. Our non-detection of radio bursts is consistent with expectations of giant pulse emission from a Crab-like young neutron star population in M87. However, the dense, strongly magnetized interstellar medium surrounding the central $\sim 10^9 \ M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole of M87 may potentially harbor magnetars that can emit detectable radio bursts during their flaring states.",astro-ph.HE

Here we report the detection of the multi-component FRB 20191221A and the identification of a periodic separation of 216.8(1) ms between its components with a significance of 6.5 sigmas. The long (~3 s) duration and nine or more components forming the pulse profile make this source an outlier in the FRB population. Such short periodicity provides strong evidence for a neutron-star origin of the event. Moreover, our detection favours emission arising from the neutron-star magnetosphere, as opposed to emission regions located further away from the star, as predicted by some models.",astro-ph.HE

Li et al.,A bimodal burst energy distribution of a repeating fast radio burst source,"The event rate, energy distribution, and time-domain behaviour of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) contains essential information regarding their physical nature and central engine, which are as yet unknown. As the first precisely-localized source, FRB 121102 has been extensively observed and shows non-Poisson clustering of bursts over time and a power-law energy distribution. However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not known. Here we report the detection of 1652 independent bursts with a peak burst rate of 122~hr^{-1}, in 59.5 hours spanning 47 days. A peak in the isotropic equivalent energy distribution is found to be ~4.8 x 10^{37} erg at 1.25~GHz, below which the detection of bursts is suppressed. The burst energy distribution is bimodal, and well characterized by a combination of a log-normal function and a generalized Cauchy function. The large number of bursts in hour-long spans allow sensitive periodicity searches between 1 ms and 1000 s. The non-detection of any periodicity or quasi-periodicity poses challenges for models involving a single rotating compact object. The high burst rate also implies that FRBs must be generated with a high radiative efficiency, disfavoring emission mechanisms with large energy requirements or contrived triggering conditions.",astro-ph.HE

The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) has localised 11 FRBs with sub-arcsecond to arcsecond precision, leading to sub-galaxy localisation regions in some cases and those covering much of the host galaxy in others. The method used to astrometrically register the FRB image frame for ASKAP, in order to align it with images taken at other wavelengths, is currently limited by the brightness of continuum sources detected in the short-duration ('snapshot') voltage data captured by the Commensal Real-Time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) software correlator, which are used to correct for any frame offsets due to imperfect calibration solutions and estimate the accuracy of any required correction. In this paper, we use dedicated observations of bright, compact radio sources in ASKAP's low- and mid-frequency bands to investigate the typical astrometric accuracy of the positions obtained using this so-called 'snapshot' technique. Having captured these data with both the CRAFT software and ASKAP hardware correlators, we also compare the offset distributions obtained from both data products to estimate a typical offset between the image frames resulting from the differing processing paths, laying the groundwork for future use of the longer-duration, higher signal-to-noise ratio data recorded by the hardware correlator. We find typical offsets between the two frames of $\sim 0.6$ and $\sim 0.3$ arcsec in the low- and mid-band data, respectively, for both RA and Dec. We also find reasonable agreement between our offset distributions and those of the published FRBs. <Abridged>",astro-ph.IM

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), triggered by FRB detections from CHIME/FRB will solve the challenge of localization for non-repeating events. Using a refurbished 10-m radio dish at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located in Ontario Canada, we developed a testbed for a VLBI experiment with a theoretical ~<30 masec precision. We provide an overview of the 10-m system and describe its refurbishment, the data acquisition, and a procedure for fringe fitting that simultaneously estimates the geometric delay used for localization and the dispersive delay from the ionosphere. Using single pulses from the Crab pulsar, we validate the system and localization procedure, and analyze the clock stability between sites, which is critical for phase-referencing an FRB event. We find a localization of 50 masec is possible with the performance of the current system. Furthermore, for sources with insufficient signal or restricted wideband to simultaneously measure both geometric and ionospheric delays, we show that the differential ionospheric contribution between the two sites must be measured to a precision of 1e-8 pc/cc to provide a reasonable localization from a detection in the 400--800 MHz band. Finally we show detection of an FRB observed simultaneously in the CHIME and the Algonquin 10-m telescope, the first FRB cross-correlated in this very long baseline.

In total, we detected 133 bursts in three hours of data at a center frequency of 1.4 GHz using the Arecibo telescope, and develop robust modeling strategies to constrain the spectro-temporal properties of all the bursts in the sample. Most of the burst profiles show a scattering tail, and burst spectra are well modeled by a Gaussian with a median width of 230 MHz. We find a lack of emission below 1300 MHz, consistent with previous studies of FRB 121102. We also find that the peak of the log-normal distribution of wait times decreases from 207 s to 75 s using our larger sample of bursts, as compared to that of Gourdji et al. (2019). Our observations do not favor either Poissonian or Weibull distributions for the burst rate distribution. We searched for periodicity in the bursts using multiple techniques but did not detect any significant period. The cumulative burst energy distribution exhibits a broken power-law shape, with the lower and higher-energy slopes of $-0.4\pm0.1$ and $-1.8\pm0.2$, with the break at $(2.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{37}$ ergs.

We demonstrate that the bunch's electrostatic energy required to produce observed brightness temperature is prohibitively high, of the order of the total {\it bulk } energy.

Association to a globular cluster (or other old stellar systems) suggests that strongly magnetized neutron stars, which are the most likely objects responsible for FRBs, are born not only when young massive stars undergo core-collapse, but also by mergers of old white dwarfs. We find that the fractional contribution to the total FRB rate by old stellar populations is at least a few percent, and the precise fraction can be constrained by FRB searches in the directions of nearby galaxies, both star-forming and elliptical ones. Using very general arguments, we show that the activity time of the M81-FRB object is between 10^4 and 10^6 years, and more likely of order 10^5 years. The energetics of radio outbursts puts a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of 10^{13} G, and the spin period > 0.2 sec, thereby ruling out the source being a milli-second pulsar. The upper limit on the persistent X-ray luminosity (provided by Chandra), together with the high FRB luminosity and frequent repetitions, severely constrains (or rules out) the possibility that the M81-FRB is a scaled-up version of giant pulses from Galactic pulsars. Finally, the 50 ns variability time of the FRB lightcurve suggests that the emission is produced in a compact region inside the neutron star magnetosphere, as it cannot be accounted for when the emission is at distances > 10^{10} cm.",astro-ph.HE

Using a combination of simulated and real FRB events, we summarize the main features of the pipeline and highlight the dominant systematics affecting the polarized signal. We compare parametric (QU-fitting) and non-parametric (rotation measure synthesis) methods for determining the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and find the latter method susceptible to systematic errors from known instrumental effects of CHIME/FRB observations. These errors include a leakage artefact that appears as polarized signal near $\rm{RM\sim 0 \; rad \, m^{-2}}$ and an RM sign ambiguity introduced by path length differences in the system's electronics.

In this Letter, we explore dynamical formation scenarios for objects in old globular clusters that may plausibly power FRBs. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that young neutron stars may form in globular clusters at a rate of up to $\sim50\,\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ through a combination of binary white dwarf mergers, white dwarf--neutron star mergers, binary neutron star mergers, and accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs in binary systems. We consider two FRB emission mechanisms: First, we show that a magnetically-powered source (e.g., a magnetar with field strength $\gtrsim10^{14}\,$G) is viable for radio emission efficiencies $\gtrsim10^{-4}$. This would require magnetic activity lifetimes longer than the associated spin-down timescales and longer than empirically-constrained lifetimes of Galactic magnetars. Alternatively, if these dynamical formation channels produce young rotation-powered neutron stars with spin periods of $\sim10\,$ms and magnetic fields of $\sim10^{11}\,$G (corresponding to spin-down lifetimes of $\gtrsim10^5\,$yr), the inferred event rate and energetics can be reasonably reproduced for order unity duty cycles. Additionally, we show that recycled millisecond pulsars or low-mass X-ray binaries similar to those well-observed in Galactic globular clusters may also be plausible channels, but only if their duty cycle for producing bursts similar to the M81 FRB is small.",astro-ph.HE

Here, we introduce a software package PyGEDM which provides a unified application programming interface (API) for these models and the YT20 (Yamasaki & Totani, 2020) model of the Galactic halo. We use PyGEDM to compute all-sky maps of Galactic dispersion measure (DM) for YMW16 and NE2001, and compare the large-scale differences between the two. In general, YMW16 predicts higher DM values toward the Galactic anticentre. YMW16 predicts higher DMs at low Galactic latitudes, but NE2001 predicts higher DMs in most other directions. We identify lines of sight for which the models are most discrepant, using pulsars with independent distance measurements. YMW16 performs better on average than NE2001, but both models show significant outliers. We suggest that future campaigns to determine pulsar distances should focus on targets where the models show large discrepancies, so future models can use those measurements to better estimate distances along those line of sight. We also suggest that the Galactic halo should be considered as a component in future GEDMs, to avoid overestimating the Galactic DM contribution for extragalactic sources such as FRBs.",astro-ph.GA

From spectroscopic observations using the 6.5-m MMT Observatory, we derive a redshift of $z=0.0979 \pm 0.0001$, a star formation rate inferred from H$\alpha$ emission of SFR(H$\alpha$) $\approx 2.1 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$\approx 9.0$. By jointly modeling the 12-filter optical-mid-infrared (MIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the host, we infer a median stellar mass of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, internal dust extinction of $A_V\approx 1-1.5$ mag, and a mass-weighted stellar population age of $\approx 5-6$ Gyr. Connecting these data to the radio and X-ray observations, we cannot reconcile the broad-band behavior with strong AGN activity and instead attribute the dominant source of persistent radio emission to star formation, likely originating from the circumnuclear region of the host. The modeling also indicates a hot dust component contributing to the MIR luminosity at a level of $\approx 10-30\%$. We model the host galaxy's star formation and mass assembly histories, finding that the host assembled $>90\%$ of its mass by 1 Gyr ago and exhibited a fairly constant SFR for most of its existence, with no clear evidence of past star-burst activity.",astro-ph.GA

We present deep CCD images with the 10.4-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), reaching brightness $r \sim 26$ mag, that reveal possible optical counterparts, although these counterparts could equally well be just chance projections. The incidence of transients in the investigated photographic plate is far higher than expected from known detection rates of optical counterparts to e.g.\ flaring dwarf stars, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) or microlensing events. One possible explanation is that the plates have been subjected to an unknown type of contamination producing mainly point sources with of varying intensities along with some mechanism of concentration within a radius of $\sim$ 10 arcmin on the plate. If contamination as an explanation can be fully excluded, another possibility is fast (t $<0.5$ s) solar reflections from objects near geosynchronous orbits.

We show that millisecond burst of sufficient power can be generated by synchrotron maser emission ignited at the reverse shock propagating through the weakly magnetized material that forms the magnetar flare. If the maser emission is generated in an anisotropic regime (due to the geometry of the production region or presence of an intense external source of stimulating photons) the duration of the maser flashes is similar to the magnetar flare duration even if the shock front radius is large. Our scenario allows relaxing the requirements for several key parameters: the magnetic field strength at the production site, luminosity of the flare, and the production site bulk Lorentz factor. To check the feasibility of this model, we study the statistical relation between powerful magnetar flares and the rate of FRBs. The expected ratio is derived by convoluting the redshift-dependent magnetar density with their flare luminosity function above the energy limit determined by the FRB detection threshold. We obtain that only a small fraction, $\sim10^{-5}$, of powerful magnetar flares trigger FRBs. This ratio agrees surprisingly well with our estimates: we obtained that $10\%$ of magnetars should be in the evolutionary phase suitable for the production of FRBs, and only $10^{-4}$ of all flares are expected to be weakly magnetized, which is a necessary condition for the high-frequency maser emission.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2106.09710,Vikram Ravi et al.,The host galaxy and persistent radio counterpart of FRB 20201124A,"The physical properties of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies provide important clues towards the nature of FRB sources. The 16 FRB hosts identified thus far span three orders of magnitude in mass and specific star-formation rate, implicating a ubiquitously occurring progenitor object. FRBs localised with ~arcsecond accuracy also enable effective searches for associated multi-wavelength and multi-timescale counterparts, such as the persistent radio source associated with FRB 20121102A. Here we present a localisation of the repeating source FRB 20201124A, and its association with a host galaxy (SDSS J050803.48+260338.0, z=0.098) and persistent radio source. The galaxy is massive ($\sim3\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$), star-forming (few solar masses per year), and dusty. Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array observations of the persistent radio source measure a luminosity of $1.2\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, and show that is extended on scales $\gtrsim50$ mas. We associate this radio emission with the ongoing star-formation activity in SDSS J050803.48+260338.0. Deeper, more detailed observations are required to better utilise the milliarcsecond-scale localisation of FRB 20201124A reported from the European VLBI Network, and determine the origin of the large dispersion measure ($150-220$ pc cm$^{-3}$) contributed by the host. SDSS J050803.48+260338.0 is an order of magnitude more massive than any galaxy or stellar system previously associated with a repeating FRB source, but is comparable to the hosts of so far non-repeating FRBs, further building the link between the two apparent populations.",astro-ph.HE

Our derived luminosity limits indicate that only the most luminous radio pulsars known in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) would have been detectable in our search if they were at the distances of Leo A and T.

Kelly et al.,EAGLE-Auriga: effects of different subgrid models on the baryon cycle around Milky Way-mass galaxies,"Modern hydrodynamical simulations reproduce many properties of the real universe. These simulations model various physical processes, but many of these are included using `subgrid models' due to resolution limits. Although different subgrid models have been successful in modelling the effects of supernovae (SNe) feedback on galactic properties, it remains unclear if, and by how much, these differing implementations affect observable halo gas properties. In this work, we use `zoom-in' cosmological initial conditions of two volumes selected to resemble the Local Group (LG) evolved with both the Auriga and EAGLE galaxy formation models. While the subgrid physics models in both simulations reproduce realistic stellar components of $L^\star$ galaxies, they exhibit different gas properties. Namely, Auriga predicts that the Milky Way (MW) is almost baryonically closed, whereas EAGLE suggests that only half of the expected baryons reside within the halo. Furthermore, EAGLE predicts that this baryon deficiency extends to the LG, ($r \leq 1 \mathrm{~Mpc}$). The baryon deficiency in EAGLE is likely due to SNe feedback at high redshift, which generates halo-wide outflows, with high covering fractions and radial velocities, which both eject baryons and significantly impede cosmic gas accretion. Conversely, in Auriga, gas accretion is almost unaffected by feedback. These differences appear to be the result of the different energy injection methods from SNe to gas. Our results suggest that both quasar absorption lines and fast radio burst dispersion measures could constrain these two regimes with future observations.",astro-ph.GA

Yet FRB sources are rare, and most of these objects, found in the Galaxy, do not make FRB. Special and rare circumstances may be required for these common objects to be sources of FRB. The recent discovery of a repeating FRB in a globular cluster belonging to the galaxy M81 suggests a model involving a neutron star and a close binary companion, likely a white dwarf; both neutron stars and close binaries are superabundant in globular clusters. Magnetic interaction is a plausible, though unproven, mechanism of acceleration of relativistic particles that may radiate coherently as FRB. Double neutron star binaries cannot be the observed long-lived repeating FRB sources, but might make much shorter lived sources, and perhaps non-repeating FRB.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2106.05212,"J. I.

Historical examples include the many types of supernov\ae\ and short {\it vs.\/} long Gamma Ray Bursts. There may be only one parameter and one outlier, so that principal component analyses are inapplicable. A qualitative difference implies that some parameter has a characteristic scale, and hence its distribution cannot be a power law (that can have no such scale). If the distribution is a power law the objects differ only quantitatively. The applicability of a power law to an empirical distribution may be tested by comparing the most extreme member to its next-most extreme. The probability distribution of their ratio is calculated, and compared to data for stars, radio and X-ray sources, and the fluxes, fluences and rotation measures of Fast Radio Bursts. It is found with high statistical significance that the giant outburst of soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20 differed qualitatively from its lesser outbursts and FRB 200428 differed qualitatively from other FRB (by location in the Galaxy), but that in some supernova remnant models of rotation measure FRB 121102 is not, statistically significantly, an outlier.",astro-ph.HE

The detection of the first Galactic FRB 20200428 from SGR 1935+2154 has made this hypothesis more convincing. In October 2020, this source was supposed to be in an extremely active state again. We then carried out a 1.6-hours follow-up observation of SGR 1935+2154 using the new ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver of the Parkes 64\,m radio telescope covering a frequency range of 704$-$4032 MHz. However, no convincing signal was detected in either of our single pulse or periodicity searches. We obtained a limit on the flux density of periodic signal of $\rm 3.6\,\mu Jy$ using the full 3.3GHz bandwidth data sets, which is the strictest limit for that of SGR 1935+2154. Our full bandwidth limit on the single pulses fluence is 35mJy ms, which is well below the brightest single pulses detected by the FAST radio telescope just two before our observation.

The catalog consists of 61 bursts from 18 repeating sources, plus 474 one-off FRBs, detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 2. We identify four observed archetypes of burst morphology (""simple broadband,"" ""simple narrowband,"" ""temporally complex"" and ""downward drifting"") and describe relevant instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths and we show, for the first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in bandwidth. This difference could be due to a beaming or propagation effects, or it could be intrinsic to the populations. We discuss potential implications of these morphological differences for using FRBs as astrophysical tools.",astro-ph.HE

The level of cross-correlation is consistent with an order-one fraction of the CHIME FRBs being in the same dark matter halos as survey galaxies in this redshift range. We find statistical evidence for a population of FRBs with large host dispersion measure ($\sim 400$ pc cm$^{-3}$), and show that this can plausibly arise from gas in large halos ($M \sim 10^{14} M_\odot$), for FRBs near the halo center ($r \lesssim 100$ kpc).

We first select CHIME/FRB events above a specified sensitivity threshold in consideration of the radiometer equation, and then compare these detections with the expected cumulative time-weighted exposure using Anderson-Darling and Kolmogrov-Smirnov tests. These tests are consistent with the null hypothesis that FRBs are distributed without Galactic latitude dependence ($p$-values distributed from 0.05 to 0.99, depending on completeness threshold). Additionally, we compare rates in intermediate latitudes ($|b| < 15^\circ$) with high latitudes using a Bayesian framework, treating the question as a biased coin-flipping experiment -- again for a range of completeness thresholds. In these tests the isotropic model is significantly favored (Bayes factors ranging from 3.3 to 14.2).

The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and non-repeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent non-repeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent non-repeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs - comprising a large fraction of the overall population - with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB. We infer a power-law index for the cumulative fluence distribution of $\alpha=-1.40\pm0.11(\textrm{stat.})^{+0.06}_{-0.09}(\textrm{sys.})$, consistent with the $-3/2$ expectation for a non-evolving population in Euclidean space. We find $\alpha$ is steeper for high-DM events and shallower for low-DM events, which is what would be expected when DM is correlated with distance. We infer a sky rate of $[525\pm30(\textrm{stat.})^{+140}_{-130}({\textrm{sys.}})]/\textrm{sky}/\textrm{day}$ above a fluence of 5 Jy ms at 600 MHz, with scattering time at $600$ MHz under 10 ms, and DM above 100 pc cm$^{-3}$.",astro-ph.HE

Besides the original funnel mode of the binary comb model, which was applied to FRB 180916.J0158+65 by Ioka and Zhang 2020, we also identify two new modes of the binary comb model, i.e. the tau-crossing mode and the inverse funnel mode, and apply them to interpret FRB 121102. These new developments expand the applicable parameter space, allowing the companion star to be a massive star, a massive black hole, or a supermassive black hole, with the latter two having larger parameter spaces. These models are also consistent with other observations, such as the persistent bright radio counterpart associated with the source. We also argue that the observed frequency dependence of the active window does not disfavor the binary comb model, in contrast to recent claims, and propose two possible scenarios to interpret the data.",astro-ph.HE

The narrow-band giant pulses consist of both main- and inter-pulses, thereby being more likely to be caused by an intrinsic emission mechanism as opposed to a propagation effect. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have demonstrated similar narrow-band features while only little has been observed in the giant pulses of pulsars. We report the narrow-band giant pulses with $\Delta \nu / \nu$ on the order of 0.1, which is close to the value of 0.05 reported for the repeater FRB 20190711A.

arXiv:2105.13122,Kun Xu et al.,Do the periodic activities of repeating fast radio bursts represent the spins of neutron stars?,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with millisecond durations.

For isolated neutron stars, the spin evolution suggests that it's difficult to reach several hours. In this work, we mainly focus on the possible maximum spin period of isolated NSs / magnetars dominated by an interaction between star's magnetic field and the disk. We find that the disk wind plays an important role in spin evolution, whose influence varies the power law index in the evolution equation of mass flow rate. For a magnetar without disk wind, the longest spin period is tens of hours. When the disk wind with a classical parameter is involved, the maximum spin period can reach hundreds of hours. But for a much extremely large index of mass flow rate due to disk wind or other angular momentum extraction processes, a spin period of $\sim$(16-160) days is still possible.",astro-ph.HE

Their high luminosities and short durations require extreme energy densities, like those found in the vicinity of neutron stars and black holes. Studying the burst intensities and polarimetric properties on a wide range of timescales, from milliseconds down to nanoseconds, is key to understanding the emission mechanism. However, high-time-resolution studies of FRBs are limited by their unpredictable activity levels, available instrumentation and temporal broadening in the intervening ionised medium. Here we show that the repeating FRB 20200120E can produce isolated shots of emission as short as about 60 nanoseconds in duration, with brightness temperatures as high as $3\times 10^{41}$ K (excluding relativistic effects), comparable to `nano-shots' from the Crab pulsar. Comparing both the range of timescales and luminosities, we find that FRB 20200120E observationally bridges the gap between known Galactic young pulsars and magnetars, and the much more distant extragalactic FRBs. This suggests a common magnetically powered emission mechanism spanning many orders of magnitude in timescale and luminosity. In this work, we probe a relatively unexplored region of the short-duration transient phase space; we highlight that there likely exists a population of ultra-fast radio transients at nanosecond to microsecond timescales, which current FRB searches are insensitive to.",astro-ph.HE

Kirsten et al.,A repeating fast radio burst source in a globular cluster,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are exceptionally luminous flashes of unknown physical origin, reaching us from other galaxies (Petroff et al. 2019). Most FRBs have only ever been seen once, while others flash repeatedly, though sporadically (Spitler et al. 2016, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). Many models invoke magnetically powered neutron stars (magnetars) as the engines producing FRB emission (Margalit & Metzger 2018, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020). Recently, CHIME/FRB announced the discovery (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) of the repeating FRB 20200120E, coming from the direction of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy M81. Four potential counterparts at other observing wavelengths were identified (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) but no definitive association with these sources, or M81, could be made. Here we report an extremely precise localisation of FRB 20200120E, which allows us to associate it with a globular cluster (GC) in the M81 galactic system and to place it ~2pc offset from the optical center of light of the GC. This confirms (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) that FRB 20200120E is 40 times closer than any other known extragalactic FRB. Because such GCs host old stellar populations, this association strongly challenges FRB models that invoke young magnetars formed in a core-collapse supernova as powering FRB emission. We propose, instead, that FRB 20200120E is a highly magnetised neutron star formed via either accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf or via merger of compact stars in a binary system (Margalit et al. 2019). Alternative scenarios involving compact binary systems, efficiently formed inside globular clusters, could also be responsible for the observed bursts.",astro-ph.HE

This repeating fast radio burst (FRB) was recently discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) instrument and reported to be associated with the M81 spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The high time resolution capabilities of the recording system used in this observation, together with the small amount of scattering and intrinsic brightness of the burst, allow us to explore the burst structure in unprecedented detail. We find that the burst has a duration of roughly 30 $\mu$s and is comprised of several narrow components with typical separations of 2--3 $\mu$s. The narrowest component has a width of $\lesssim$ 100 ns, which corresponds to a light travel time size as small as 30 m, the smallest associated with an FRB to date. The peak flux density of the narrowest burst component is 270 Jy. We estimate the total spectral luminosity of the narrowest component of the burst to be 4 $\times$ 10$^{\text{30}}$ erg s$^{\text{-1}}$ Hz$^{\text{-1}}$, which is a factor of $\sim$500 above the luminosities of the so-called ""nanoshots"" associated with giant pulses from the Crab pulsar. This spectral luminosity is also higher than that of the radio bursts detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its outburst in April 2020, but it falls on the low-end of the currently measured luminosity distribution of extragalatic FRBs. These results provide further support for the presence of a continuum of FRB burst luminosities.",astro-ph.HE

Like the Crab pulsar it is observed to emit giant radio pulses (GPs). We used the newly-commissioned PTUSE instrument on the MeerKAT radio telescope to search for GPs across three observations. In a total integration time of 5.7 hrs we detected 865 pulses above our 7$\sigma$ threshold. With full polarisation information for a subset of the data, we estimated the Faraday rotation measure, $\rm{RM}=-245.8 \pm 1.0$ rad m$^{-2}$ toward the pulsar. The brightest of these pulses is $\sim$ 60% linearly polarised but the pulse-to-pulse variability in the polarisation fraction is significant. We find that the cumulative GP flux distribution follows a power law distribution with index $-2.75 \pm 0.02$. Although the detected GPs make up only $\sim$ 10% of the mean flux, their average pulse shape is indistinguishable from the integrated pulse profile, and we postulate that there is no underlying emission. The pulses are scattered at L-band frequencies with the brightest pulse exhibiting a scattering time-scale of $\tau = 0.92 \pm 0.02$ ms at 1.2 GHz. We find several of the giants display very narrow-band ""flux knots"" similar to those seen in many Fast Radio Bursts, which we assert cannot be due to scintillation or plasma lensing. The GP time-of-arrival distribution is found to be Poissonian on all but the shortest time-scales where we find four GPs in six rotations, which if GPs are statistically independent is expected to occur in only 1 of 7000 observations equivalent to our data.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2105.08851,Akanksha Bij et al.,Kinematics of Crab Giant Pulses,"The Crab Pulsar's radio emission is unusual, consisting predominantly of giant pulses, with durations of about a micro-second but structure down to the nano-second level, and brightness temperatures of up to $10^{37}\,$K. It is unclear how giant pulses are produced, but they likely originate near the pulsar's light cylinder, where corotating plasma approaches the speed of light. We report observations in the 400-800 MHz frequency band, where the pulses are broadened by scattering in the surrounding Crab nebula. We find that some pulse frequency spectra show strong bands, which vary during the scattering tail, in one case showing a smooth upward drift. While the banding may simply reflect interference between nano-second scale pulse components, the variation is surprising, as in the scattering tail the only difference is that the source is observed via slightly longer paths, bent by about an arcsecond in the nebula. The corresponding small change in viewing angle could nevertheless reproduce the observed drift by a change in Doppler shift, if the plasma that emitted the giant pulses moved highly relativistically, with a Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim10^4$ (and without much spread in $\gamma$). If so, this would support models that appeal to highly relativistic plasma to transform ambient magnetic structures to coherent GHz radio emission, be it for giant pulses or for potentially related sources, such as fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Lens Mass Estimation for Doubly Imaged FRBs,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events with durations on the order of milliseconds. The majority of FRB sources discovered so far have a single peak, with the exception of a few showing multiple-peaked profiles, the origin of which is unknown. In this work, we show that the strong lensing effect of a point mass or a point mass $+$ external shear on a single-peak FRB can produce double peaks (i.e. lensed images). In particular, the leading peak will always be more magnified and hence brighter than the trailing peak for a point-mass lens model, while the point-mass $+$ external shear lens model can produce a less magnified leading peak. We find that, for a point-mass lens model, the combination of lens mass $M$ and redshift $z_l$ in the form of $M(1+z_l)$ can be directly computed from two observables -- the delayed time $\Delta t$ and the flux ratio of the leading peak to the trailing peak $R$. For a point-mass $+$ external shear lens model, upper and lower limits in $M(1+z_l)$ can also be obtained from $\Delta t$ and $R$ for a given external shear strength. In particular, tighter lens mass constraints can be achieved when the observed $R$ is larger. Lastly, we show the process of constraining lens mass using the observed values of $\Delta t$ and $R$ of two double-peaked FRB sources, i.e. FRB 121002 and FRB 130729, as references, although the double-peaked profiles are not necessarily caused by strong lensing.",astro-ph.GA

Galactocentric offsets, enclosed fluxes and the fraction of light statistic are widely used at different wavelengths to help infer the nature of transient progenitors. Motivated by the proposed link between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), we create a face-on image of the Milky Way using best estimates of its size, structure and colour. We place Galactic magnetars, pulsars, low mass and high mass X-ray binaries on this image, using the available distance information. Galactocentric offsets, enclosed fluxes and fraction of light distributions for these systems are compared to extragalactic transient samples. We find that FRBs follow the distributions for Galactic neutron stars closest, with 24 (75 per cent) of the Anderson-Darling tests we perform having a p-value greater than 0.05. This suggests that FRBs are located on their hosts in a manner consistent with Galactic neutron stars on the Milky Way's light, although we cannot determine which specific neutron star population is the best match. The Galactic distributions are consistent with other extragalactic transients much less often across the range of comparisons made, with type Ia SNe in second place, at only 33 per cent of tests exceeding 0.05.

Verrecchia et al.,AGILE Observations of Fast Radio Bursts,"We report on a systematic search for hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission in coincidence with fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed by the AGILE satellite. We used 13 years of AGILE archival data searching for time coincidences between exposed FRBs and events detectable by the MCAL (0.4-100 MeV) and GRID (50 MeV-30 GeV) detectors at timescales ranging from milliseconds to days/weeks. The current AGILE sky coverage allowed us to extend the search for high-energy emission preceding and following the FRB occurrence. We considered all FRBs sources currently included in catalogues, and identified a sub-sample (15 events) for which a good AGILE exposure either with MCAL or GRID was obtained. In this paper we focus on non-repeating FRBs, compared to a few nearby repeating sources. We did not detect significant MeV or GeV emission from any event. Our hard X-ray upper limits (ULs) in the MeV energy range were obtained for timescales from sub-millisecond to seconds, and in the GeV range from minutes to weeks around event times. We focus on a sub-set of 5 non-repeating and 2 repeating FRB sources whose distances are most likely smaller than that of 180916.J0158+65 (150 Mpc). For these sources, our MeV ULs translate into ULs on the isotropically-emitted energy of about 3x10^46 erg, comparable to that observed in the 2004 giant flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1806-20. On average, these nearby FRBs emit radio pulses of energies significantly larger than the recently detected SGR 1935+2154 and are not yet associated with intense MeV flaring.",astro-ph.HE

The Breakthrough Listen program is undertaking the most sensitive and deepest targeted SETI surveys towards the GC. Here, we outline our observing strategies with Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Parkes telescope to conduct 600 hours of deep observations across 0.7--93 GHz. We report preliminary results from our survey for ETI beacons across 1--8 GHz with 7.0 and 11.2 hours of observations with Parkes and GBT, respectively. With our narrowband drifting signal search, we were able to place meaningful constraints on ETI transmitters across 1--4 GHz and 3.9--8 GHz with EIRP limits of $\geq$4$\times$10$^{18}$ W among 60 million stars and $\geq$5$\times$10$^{17}$ W among half a million stars, respectively. For the first time, we were able to constrain the existence of artificially dispersed transient signals across 3.9--8 GHz with EIRP $\geq$1$\times$10$^{14}$ W/Hz with a repetition period $\leq$4.3 hours. We also searched our 11.2 hours of deep observations of the GC and its surrounding region for Fast Radio Burst-like magnetars with the DM up to 5000 pc cm$^{-3}$ with maximum pulse widths up to 90 ms at 6 GHz. We detected several hundred transient bursts from SGR J1745$-$2900, but did not detect any new transient burst with the peak luminosity limit across our observed band of $\geq$10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and burst-rate of $\geq$0.23 burst-hr$^{-1}$. These limits are comparable to bright transient emission seen from other Galactic radio-loud magnetars, constraining their presence at the GC.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2104.11680,Nihan Pol et al.,The Location of Young Pulsar PSR J0837$-$2454: Galactic Halo or Local Supernova Remnant?,"We present the discovery and timing of the young (age $\sim 28.6$ kyr) pulsar PSR J0837$-$2454. Based on its high latitude ($b = 9.8^{\circ}$) and dispersion measure (DM $ = 143$~pc~cm$^{-3}$), the pulsar appears to be at a $z$-height of $>$1 kpc above the Galactic plane, but near the edge of our Galaxy. This is many times the observed scale height of the canonical pulsar population, which suggests this pulsar may have been born far out of the plane. If accurate, the young age and high $z$-height imply that this is the first pulsar known to be born from a runaway O/B star. In follow-up imaging with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we detect the pulsar with a flux density $S_{1400} = 0.18 \pm 0.05$ mJy. We do not detect an obvious supernova remnant around the pulsar in our ATCA data, but we detect a co-located, low-surface-brightness region of $\sim$1.5$^\circ$ extent in archival Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey data. We also detect co-located H$\alpha$ emission from the Southern H$\alpha$ Sky Survey Atlas. Distance estimates based on these two detections come out to $\sim$0.9 kpc and $\sim$0.2 kpc respectively, both of which are much smaller than the distance predicted by the NE2001 model ($6.3$ kpc) and YMW model ($>25$ kpc) and place the pulsar much closer to the plane of the Galaxy. If the pulsar/remnant association holds, this result also highlights the inherent difficulty in the classification of transients as ""Galactic"" (pulsar) or ""extragalactic"" (fast radio burst) toward the Galactic anti-center based solely on the modeled Galactic electron contribution to a detection.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2104.11617,Xiang-Han Cui et al.,Statistical properties of fast radio bursts elucidate their origins: magnetars are favoured over gamma-ray bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely strong radio flares lasting several milliseconds, most of which come from unidentified objects at a cosmological distance. They can be apparently repeating or not. In this paper, we analyzed 18 repeaters and 12 non-repeating FRBs observed in the frequency bands of 400-800 MHz from CHIME. We investigated the distributions of FRB isotropic-equivalent radio luminosity, considering the K correction. Statistically, the luminosity distribution can be better fitted by Gaussian form than by power-law. Based on the above results, together with the observed FRB event rate, pulse duration, and radio luminosity, FRB origin models are evaluated and constrained such that the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be excluded for the non-repeaters while magnetars or neutron stars (NSs) emitting the supergiant pulses are preferred for the repeaters. We also found the necessity of a small FRB emission beaming solid angle (about 0.1 sr) from magnetars that should be considered, and/or the FRB association with soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) may lie at a low probability of about 10%. Finally, we discussed the uncertainty of FRB luminosity caused by the estimation of the distance that is inferred by the simple relation between the redshift and dispersion measure (DM).",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2104.11389,"Aiichi Iwazaki, ",Spectral-temporal features of repeating ( one-off ) FRBs and Axion Star,"The fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) are energetic radio bursts with millisecond duration only observed at radio frequencies. The generation mechanism is still mysterious. We have proposed a generation mechanism of both repeating and one-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron star or magnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence of the axions, we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed spectral-temporal features. In this paper we show that it also explains recently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the repeating FRBs, etc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been presented in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or atom has been proposed as a source of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our mechanism and find that it well explains the relation between the downward drifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead to the fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is shorter than that of radio burst with lower center frequency in the repeating FRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain polarization angle swing observed in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs. We also discuss the association between the FRB200428 and magnetar SGR J1935+2154. The X ray burst observed just after the observation of the FRB could be triggered by the axion star collision with the magnetar. We also explain the consistency of our generation mechanism with observed spectral-temporal differences in the repeating and one-off FRBs, e.g. longer duration ( smaller flux density ) of repeating FRBs than duration ( flux density ) of one-off FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2104.09727,C. NuÃ±ez et al.,Constraining bright optical counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic pulses of millisecond duration and unknown origin. In order to understand the phenomenon that emits these pulses, targeted and untargeted searches have been performed for multi-wavelength counterparts, including the optical. The objective of this work is to search for optical transients at the position of 8 well-localized FRBs, after the arrival of the burst on different time-scales (typically at one day, several months, and one year after FRB detection) in order to compare with known transient optical light curves. We used the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT), which allows us to promptly take images owing to its network of twenty-three telescopes working around the world. We used a template subtraction technique on all the images we collected at different epochs. We have divided the subtractions into two groups, in one group we use the image of the last epoch as a template and in the other group we use the image of the first epoch as a template. We have searched for bright optical transients at the localizations of the FRBs (<1 arcsec) in the template subtracted images. We have found no optical transients, so we have set limiting magnitudes of optical counterparts. Typical limiting magnitudes in apparent (absolute) magnitudes for our LCOGT data are ~22 (-19) mag in the r-band. We have compared our limiting magnitudes with light curves of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), type Ia supernovae (SNe), supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB SNe), a kilonova, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We rule out that FRBs are associated with SLSN at a confidence of ~99.9%. We can also rule out the brightest sub-types of type Ia SNe, GRB SNe and TDEs (under some conditions) at similar confidence, though we cannot exclude scenarios where FRBs are associated with the faintest sub-type of each of these transient classes.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2104.07693,"David Kipping, ",Black Swans in Astronomical Data,"Astronomy has always been propelled by the discovery of new phenomena lacking precedent, often followed by new theories to explain their existence and properties. In the modern era of large surveys tiling the sky at ever high precision and sampling rates, these serendipitous discoveries look set to continue, with recent examples including Boyajian's Star, Fast Radio Bursts and `Oumuamua. Accordingly, we here look ahead and aim to provide a statistical framework for interpreting such events and providing guidance to future observations, under the basic premise that the phenomenon in question stochastically repeat at some unknown, constant rate, $\lambda$. Specifically, expressions are derived for 1) the a-posteriori distribution for $\lambda$, 2) the a-posteriori distribution for the recurrence time, and, 3) the benefit-to-cost ratio of further observations relative to that of the inaugural event. Some rule-of-thumb results for each of these are found to be 1) $\lambda < \{0.7, 2.3, 4.6\}\,t_1^{-1}$ to $\{50, 90, 95\}\%$ confidence (where $t_1=$ time to obtain the first detection), 2) the recurrence time is $t_2 < \{1, 9, 99\}\,t_1$ to $\{50, 90, 95\}\%$ confidence, with a lack of repetition by time $t_2$ yielding a $p$-value of $1/[1+(t_2/t_1)]$, and, 3) follow-up for $\lesssim 10\,t_1$ is expected to be scientifically worthwhile under an array of differing assumptions about the object's intrinsic scientific value.

In contrast, considerable progress has recently been made in determining the structure of the magnetosphere that surrounds these objects: numerical computations based on the force-free, magnetohydrodynamic and particle-in-cell formalisms have now established that the magnetosphere of an oblique rotator entails a current sheet outside its light cylinder whose rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Here we insert the description of the current sheet provided by the numerical simulations in the classical expression for the retarded potential and thereby calculate the radiation field generated by this source in the time domain. We find a radiation consisting of highly focused pulses whose (i) spectrum can extend from radio waves to gamma rays, (ii) brightness temperature can exceed 10^(40) K, (iii) linear polarization can be 100%, (iv) two concurrent polarization position angles are approximately orthogonal often and swing through 180 deg across the pulse profile in most cases, (v) circular polarization reverses sense across some components of the pulse profile, (vi) microstructure is determined by the thickness of the current sheet, and (vii) whose flux density diminishes with the distance D from the star as D^(-3/2) (rather than D^(-2)) in certain directions. The intrinsically transient radiation process analysed here is thus capable of generating an emission whose features are strikingly similar to those of the emissions received from pulsars and magnetars and from the sources of fast radio bursts and gamma-ray bursts.",astro-ph.HE

The radio pulse undergoes dispersion caused by free electrons along the line of sight, most of which are associated with the large-scale structure (LSS). The total dispersion measure therefore increases with the line of sight and provides a distance estimate to the source. We present the first measurement of the Hubble constant using the dispersion measure -- redshift relation of FRBs with identified host counterpart and corresponding redshift information. A sample of nine currently available FRBs yields a constraint of $H_0 = 62.3 \pm 9.1 \,\rm{km} \,\rm{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainty stemming from the LSS, host halo and Milky Way contributions to the observed dispersion measure. The main current limitation is statistical, and we estimate that a few hundred events with corresponding redshifts are sufficient for a per cent measurement of $H_0$. This is a number well within reach of ongoing FRB searches. We perform a forecast using a realistic mock sample to demonstrate that a high-precision measurement of the expansion rate is possible without relying on other cosmological probes. FRBs can therefore arbitrate the current tension between early and late time measurements of $H_0$ in the near future.",astro-ph.CO

GRPs are hundreds to thousands of times brighter than regular pulses from these sources. The only GRP-associated emission outside radio wavelengths is from the Crab Pulsar, where optical emission is enhanced by a few percent during GRPs. We observed the Crab Pulsar simultaneously at X-ray and radio wavelengths, finding enhancement of the X-ray emission by $3.8\pm0.7\%$ (a 5.4$\sigma$ detection) coinciding with GRPs.

Sokolowski et al.,A Southern-Hemisphere all-sky radio transient monitor for SKA-Low prototype stations,"We present the first southern-hemisphere all-sky imager and radio-transient monitoring system implemented on two prototype stations of the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array. Since its deployment the system has been used for real-time monitoring of the recorded commissioning data. Additionally, a transient searching algorithm has been executed on the resulting all-sky images. It uses a difference imaging technique, and has enabled identification of a wide variety of transient classes, ranging from human-made radio-frequency interference to genuine astrophysical events. Observations at the frequency 159.4 MHz and higher in a single coarse channel (0.926 MHz) were made with 2s time resolution, and multiple nights were analysed. Despite having modest sensitivity (~few Jy/beam), using a single coarse channel and 2-s imaging, the system detected bright transients from PSR B0950+08, proving that it can be used to detect bright transients of an astrophysical origin. The unusual, extreme activity of the pulsar PSR B0950+08 (up to ~155 Jy/beam) was initially detected in a ""blind"" search in the 2020-04-10/11 data and later assigned to this specific pulsar. The limitations of our data, however, prevent use from making firm conclusions of the effect being due to a combination of refractive and diffractive scintillation or intrinsic emission mechanisms. The system can routinely collect data over many days without interruptions; the large amount of recorded data at 159.4 and 229.7 MHz allowed us to determine a preliminary transient surface density upper limit of $1.32 \times 10^{-9} \text{deg}^{-2}$ for a timescale and limiting flux density of 2s and 42 Jy, respectively.

arXiv:2104.01925,"Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, ",Fast radio bursts and their high-energy counterpart from magnetar magnetospheres,"The recent discovery of a Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) occurring simultaneously with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 implies that at least some FRBs arise from magnetar activities. We propose that FRBs are triggered by crust fracturing of magnetars, with the burst event rate depending on the magnetic field strength in the crust. Since the crust fracturing rate is relatively higher in polar regions, FRBs are preferred to be triggered near the directions of multipolar magnetic poles. Crust fracturing produces Alfv\'en waves, forming a charge starved region in the magnetosphere and leading to non-stationary pair plasma discharges. An FRB is produced by coherent plasma radiation due to nonuniform pair production across magnetic field lines. Meanwhile, the FRB-associated XRB is produced by the rapid relaxation of the external magnetic field lines. In this picture, the sharp-peak hard X-ray component in association with FRB 200428 is from a region between adjacent trapped fireballs, and its spectrum with a high cutoff energy is attributed to resonant Compton scattering. The persistent X-ray emission is from a hot spot heated by the magnetospheric activities, and its temperature evolution is dominated by magnetar surface cooling. Within this picture, magnetars with stronger fields tend to produce brighter and more frequent repeated bursts.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2103.15299,"Huimei Wang, Xueli Miao, Lijing Shao, ",Bounding the photon mass with cosmological propagation of fast radio bursts,"Photon is the fundamental quantum of electromagnetic fields, whose mass, $m_{\gamma}$, should be strictly zero in Maxwell's theory. But not all theories adopt this hypothesis. If the rest mass of the photon is not zero, there will be an additional time delay between photons of different frequencies after they travel through a fixed distance. By analyzing the time delay, we can measure or constrain the photon mass. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- transient radio bursts characterized by millisecond duration and cosmological propagation -- are excellent astrophysical laboratories to constrain $m_{\gamma}$. In this work we use a catalog of 129 FRBs in a Bayesian framework to constrain $m_{\gamma}$. As a result, we obtain a new bound on the photon mass, $m_{\gamma} \leq 3.1\times 10^{-51}\rm\,kg\simeq 1.7 \times 10^{-15}\,eV/c^2$ ($m_{\gamma} \leq 3.9\times 10^{-51}\rm\,kg \simeq 2.2 \times 10^{-15}\,eV/c^2$) at the $68\%$ $(95\%$) confidence level. The result represents the best limit purely from kinematic analysis of light propagation.

We then use this result to calculate the power spectrum of DM-based cosmological observables to linear order in perturbations. In particular, we study two cases: maps of the dispersion measure from a set of localized sources (including the effects of source clustering), and fluctuations in the density of DM-selected sources. The impact of most relativistic effects is limited to large angular scales, and is negligible for all practical applications in the context of ongoing and envisaged observational programs targeting fast radio bursts. We compare the leading contributions to DM-space clustering, including the effects of gravitational lensing, and find that the signal is dominated by the fluctuations in the free electron column density, rather than the local source clustering or lensing contributions. To compensate for the disappointing irrelevance of relativistic effects, we re-derive them in terms of the geodesic equation for massive particles in a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric.",astro-ph.CO

Magnetars are believed to form with millisecond spin period and to represent an important fraction of the whole population of young neutron stars. Newborn magnetars can convert very quickly their rotational energy into electromagnetic and/or gravitational waves, by virtue of their strong magnetic fields and fast spins.

While analysis of periodic events is well established, some sources, e.g. some fast radio bursts and soft gamma-ray emitters, are suspected of more subtle and less explored periodic windowed behavior: the bursts themselves are not periodic, but the activity only occurs during periodic windows. We focus here on distinguishing periodic windowed behavior from merely clustered events through time clustering analysis, using techniques analogous to spatial clustering, demonstrating methods for identifying and characterizing the behavior. An important aspect is accounting for the ``curious incident of the dog in the night time'' - lack of bursts carries information.

We use 55-hour observation for M82 galaxy carried out at Nanshan 26m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the correlated noise modelling. The number of candidates and parameter distribution of the false positives can be reproduced with the modelling of correlated noise.

arXiv:2103.08687,Dylan L. Jow et al.,Imaginary images and Stokes phenomena in the weak plasma lensing of coherent sources,"The study of astrophysical plasma lensing, such as in the case of extreme scattering events, has typically been conducted using the geometric limit of optics, neglecting wave effects. However, for the lensing of coherent sources such as pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), wave effects can play an important role. Asymptotic methods, such as the so-called Eikonal limit, also known as the stationary phase approximation, have been used to include first-order wave effects; however, these methods fail at Stokes lines. Stokes lines are generic features of a variety of lens models, and are regions in parameter space where imaginary images begin to contribute to the overall intensity modulation of lensed sources. Using the mathematical framework of Picard-Lefschetz theory to compute diffraction integrals, we argue that these imaginary images contain as much information as their geometric counterparts, and may potentially be observable in data. Thus, weak-lensing events where these imaginary images are present can be as useful for inferring lens parameters as strong-lensing events in which multiple geometric images are present.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2103.08609,Xuheng Ding et al.,Improved time-delay lens modelling and $H_0$ inference with transient sources,"Strongly lensed explosive transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves are very promising tools to determine the Hubble constant ($H_0$) in the near future in addition to strongly lensed quasars. In this work, we show that the transient nature of the point source provides an advantage over quasars: the lensed host galaxy can be observed before or after the transient's appearance. Therefore, the lens model can be derived from images free of contamination from bright point sources. We quantify this advantage by comparing the precision of a lens model obtained from the same lenses with and without point sources. Based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations with the same sets of lensing parameters, we simulate realistic mock datasets of 48 quasar lensing systems (i.e., adding AGN in the galaxy center) and 48 galaxy-galaxy lensing systems (assuming the transient source is not visible but the time delay and image positions have been or will be measured). We then model the images and compare the inferences of the lens model parameters and $H_0$. We find that the precision of the lens models (in terms of the deflector mass slope) is better by a factor of 4.1 for the sample without lensed point sources, resulting in an increase of $H_0$ precision by a factor of 2.9. The opportunity to observe the lens systems without the transient point sources provides an additional advantage for time-delay cosmography over lensed quasars. It facilitates the determination of higher signal-to-noise stellar kinematics of the main deflector, and thus its mass density profile, which in turn plays a key role in breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and constraining $H_0$.",astro-ph.CO

However, due to the discovery of merger events of black hole binaries by LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave observatories, the interest for PBHs in the stellar mass window has been aroused again. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond duration and very high all-sky occurrence rate. Lensing effect of these bursts has been proposed as one of the optimal probes for constraining the abundance of PBHs in the stellar mass range. In this paper, we first investigate constraints on the abundance of PBHs from the latest $593$ FRB observations for both the monochromatic mass distribution and three other popular extended mass distributions related to different formation mechanisms of PBHs. It is found that constraints from currently public FRB observations are relatively weaker than those from existing gravitational wave detections. Furthermore, we forecast constraining power of future FRB observations on the abundance of PBHs with different mass distributions of PBHs and different redshift distributions of FRBs taken into account. Finally, We find that constraints of parameter space on extended mass distributions from $\sim10^5$ FRBs with $\overline{\Delta t}\leq1 ~\rm ms$ would be comparable with what can be constrained from gravitational wave events. It is foreseen that upcoming complementary multi-messenger observations will yield considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs in this intriguing mass window.",astro-ph.CO

Firstly, we consider the Taylor expansion of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ up to second order, and find that the mean relative standard deviation $\sigma(f_{\rm IGM})\equiv\left\langle \sigma[f_{\rm IGM}(z)] /f_{\rm IGM}(z) \right\rangle$ is about 7.2%. In order to alleviate the dependence on fiducial model, we also adopt a non-parametric methods in this work, the local principle component analysis. We obtain the consistent, but weaker constraints on the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$, namely the mean relative standard deviation $\sigma(f_{\rm IGM})$ is 24.2%.

The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy.

The detection of an extremely luminous radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added credence to this hypothesis. We report on simultaneous and non-simultaneous observing campaigns using the Arecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross radio telescopes and the MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the April 28 event. We did not detect any significant single radio pulses down to fluence limits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms. Some observing epochs overlapped with times when X-ray bursts were detected. Radio images made on four days using the MeerKAT telescope revealed no point-like persistent or transient emission at the location of the magnetar. No transient or persistent optical emission was detected over seven days. Using the multi-colour MeerLICHT images combined with relations between DM, NH and reddening we constrain the distance to SGR J1935+2154, to be between 1.5 and 6.5 kpc. The upper limit is consistent with some other distance indicators and suggests that the April 28 burst is closer to two orders of magnitude less energetic than the least energetic FRBs. The lack of single-pulse radio detections shows that the single pulses detected over a range of fluences are either rare, or highly clustered, or both. It may also indicate that the magnetar lies somewhere between being radio-quiet and radio-loud in terms of its ability to produce radio emission efficiently.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2103.04165,"Jin-Jun Geng, Bing Li, Yong-Feng Huang, ",Repeating Fast Radio Bursts from Collapses of the Crust of a Strange Star,"Strange stars (SSs) are compact objects made of deconfined quarks. It is hard to distinguish SSs from neutron stars as a thin crust composed of normal hadronic matter may exist and obscure the whole surface of the SS. Here we suggest that the intriguing repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by the intermittent fractional collapses of the crust of an SS induced by refilling of accretion materials from its low-mass companion. The periodic/sporadic/clustered temporal behaviors of FRBs could be well understood in our scenario. Especially, the periodicity is attributed to the modulation of accretion rate through the disk instabilities. To account for a $\sim 16$-day periodicity of the repeating FRB source 180916.J0158+65, a Shakura-Sunyaev disk with a viscosity parameter of $\alpha \simeq 0.004$ and an accretion rate of $\simeq 3 \times 10^{16}$~g~s$^{-1}$ in the low state is invoked. Our scenario, if favored by future observations, will serve as indirect evidence for the strange quark matter hypothesis.",astro-ph.HE

The timing and duration of the EoR is expected to be governed by the underlying astrophysics. Furthermore, most models of reionization predict a correlation between the density and ionization field. Here we consider using the mean dispersion measure (DM) of high redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a probe of the underlying astrophysics and morphology of the EoR. To do this, we forecast observational scenarios by building mock data sets of non-repeating FRBs between redshifts $8\leq z \leq 10$. It is assumed that all FRBs have accompanying spectroscopic redshift measurements. We find that samples of 100 high redshift FRBs, in the above mentioned narrow redshift range, can rule out uncorrelated reionization at $68\%$ credibility, while larger samples, $\geq 10^4$ FRBs, can rule out uncorrelated reionization at $95\%$ credibility. We also find 100 high redshift FRBs can rule out scenarios where the Universe is entirely neutral at $z = 10$ with $68\%$ credibility. Further with $\geq 10^5$ FRBs, we can constrain the duration $\Delta z$ of reionization (duration between mean ionized fraction 0.25 to 0.75) to $\Delta z = 2.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, and the midpoint of reionization to $z = 7.8^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ at $95\%$ credibility.",astro-ph.CO

The source DM of 87.82 pc cm$^{-3}$ is the lowest recorded from an FRB to date, yet is significantly higher than the maximum expected from the Milky Way interstellar medium in this direction (~ 50 pc cm$^{-3}$). We have detected three bursts and one candidate burst from the source over the period 2020 January-November. The baseband voltage data for the event on 2020 January 20 enabled a sky localization of the source to within $\simeq$ 14 sq. arcmin (90% confidence). The FRB localization is close to M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The FRB appears on the outskirts of M81 (projected offset $\sim$ 20 kpc) but well inside its extended HI and thick disks. We empirically estimate the probability of chance coincidence with M81 to be $< 10^{-2}$. However, we cannot reject a Milky Way halo origin for the FRB. Within the FRB localization region, we find several interesting cataloged M81 sources and a radio point source detected in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). We searched for prompt X-ray counterparts in Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM data, and for two of the FRB 20200120E bursts, we rule out coincident SGR 1806$-$20-like X-ray bursts. Due to the proximity of FRB 20200120E, future follow-up for prompt multi-wavelength counterparts and sub-arcsecond localization could be constraining of proposed FRB models.",astro-ph.HE

So far several hundred events have been detected, mostly at extragalactic distances, and this number is expected to grow significantly over the next years. The radio signals from the burst experience dispersion as they travel through the free electrons along the line-of-sight characterised by the dispersion measure (DM) of the radio pulse. In addition, each photon also experiences a gravitational Shapiro time delay while travelling through the potentials generated by the large-scale structure. If the equivalence principle (EP) holds, the Shapiro delay is the same for photons of all frequencies. In case the EP is broken, one would expect an additional dispersion to occur which could be either positive or negative for individual sources. Here we suggest to use angular statistics of the DM fluctuations to put constraints on the EP parametrized by the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$. Previous studies suffer from the problem that the gravitational potential responsible for the delay diverges in a cosmological setting, which our approach avoids. We carry out a forecast for a population of FRBs observable within the next years and show that any significant detection of the DM angular power spectrum will place constraints on the EP that are by a few orders of magnitude more stringent than current limits.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2102.10627,Kshitij Aggarwal et al.,Probabilistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH),"We introduce a new method to estimate the probability that an extragalactic transient source is associated with a candidate host galaxy. This approach relies solely on simple observables: sky coordinates and their uncertainties, galaxy fluxes and angular sizes. The formalism invokes Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability P(O_i|x) from the galaxy prior P(O), observables x, and an assumed model for the true distribution of transients in/around their host galaxies. Using simulated transients placed in the well-studied COSMOS field, we consider several agnostic and physically motivated priors and offset distributions to explore the method sensitivity. We then apply the methodology to the set of 13~fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized with an uncertainty of several arcseconds. Our methodology finds nine of these are securely associated to a single host galaxy, P(O_i|x)>0.95. We examine the observed and intrinsic properties of these secure FRB hosts, recovering similar distributions as previous works. Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the apparent magnitude of the securely identified host galaxies and the estimated cosmic dispersion measures of the corresponding FRBs, which results from the Macquart relation. Future work with FRBs will leverage this relation and other measures from the secure hosts as priors for future associations. The methodology is generic to transient type, localization error, and image quality. We encourage its application to other transients where host galaxy associations are critical to the science, e.g. gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae.

Together with FRB 181123 that was reported earlier, all four FAST-discovered FRBs share the same characteristics of low fluence ($\leq$0.2 Jy ms) and high dispersion measure (DM, $>1000$ \dmu), consistent with the anti-correlation between DM and fluence of the entire FRB population. FRB 181118 and FRB 181130 exhibit band-limited features. FRB 181130 is prominently scattered ($\tau_s\simeq8$ ms) at 1.25 GHz. FRB 181017.J0036+11 has full-bandwidth emission with a fluence of 0.042 Jy ms, which is one of the faintest FRB sources detected so far. CRAFTS starts to built a new sample of FRBs that fills the region for more distant and fainter FRBs in the fluence-$\rm DM_E$ diagram, previously out of reach of other surveys. The implied all sky event rate of FRBs is $1.24^{+1.94}_{-0.90} \times 10^5$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at the $95\%$ confidence interval above 0.0146 Jy ms.

arXiv:2102.07769,"Igor Nikitin, ","On dark stars, Planck cores and the nature of dark matter","Dark stars are compact massive objects, described by Einstein gravitational field equations with matter. The type we consider possesses no event horizon, instead, there is a deep gravitational well with a very strong redshift factor. Observationally, dark stars can be identified with black holes. Inside dark stars, Planck density of matter is reached, Planck cores are formed, where the equations are modified by quantum gravity. In the paper, several models of dark stars with Planck cores are considered, resulting in the following hypothesis on the composition of dark matter. The galaxies are flooded with low-energetic radiation from the dark stars. The particle type can be photons and gravitons from the Standard Model, can also be a new type of massless particles. The model estimations show that the extremely large redshift factor $z\sim10^{49}$ and the emission wavelength $\lambda_0\sim10^{14}$m can be reached. The particles are not registered directly in the existing dark matter experiments. They come in a density sufficient to explain the observable rotation curves. The emission has a geometric dependence of density on radius $\rho\sim r^{-2}$, producing flat rotation curves. The distribution of sources also describes the deviations from the flat shape. The model provides a good fit of experimental rotation curves. Outbreaks caused by a fall of an external object on a dark star lead to emission wavelength shifted towards smaller values. The model estimations give the outbreak wavelength $\lambda\sim1$m compatible with fast radio bursts. The paper raises several principal questions. White holes with Planck core appear to be stable. Galactic rotation curves in the considered setup do not depend on the matter type. Inside the galaxy, dark matter can be of hot radial type. At cosmological distances, it can behave like the cold uniform type.",astro-ph.GA

Emission is produced by a reconnection-generated beam of particles via a variant of Free Electron Laser (FEL) mechanism, operating in a weakly-turbulent, guide-field dominated plasma. We first consider nonlinear Thomson scattering in a guide-field dominated regime, and apply to model to explain emission bands observed in Crab pulsar and in Fast Radio Bursts. We consider particle motion in a combined fields of the electromagnetic wave and thee lectromagnetic (Alfvenic) wiggler. Charge bunches, created via a ponderomotive force, Compton/Raman scatter the wiggler field coherently. The model is both robust to the underlying plasma parameters and succeeds in reproducing a number of subtle observed features: (i) emission frequencies depend mostly on the length $\lambda_t$ of turbulence and the Lorentz factor of the reconnection generated beam, $\omega \sim \gamma_b^2 ( c/\lambda_t) $ - it is independent of the absolute value of the underlying magnetic field. (ii) The model explains both broadband emission and the presence of emission stripes, including multiple stripes observed in the High Frequency Interpulse of the Crab pulsar. (iii) The model reproduces correlated polarization properties: presence of narrow emission bands in the spectrum favors linear polarization, while broadband emission can have arbitrary polarization. (iv) The mechanism is robust to the momentum spread of the particle in the beam. We also discuss a model of wigglers as non-linear force-free Alfven solitons (light darts).",astro-ph.HE

The system consists of a stellar compact object (CO) and a donor star (DS) companion in an eccentric orbit, where the DS fills its own Roche lobe near the periastron. The CO accretes the material from the DS and then drive relativistic magnetic blobs. The interaction between the magnetic blobs and the stellar wind of the DS produces a pair of shocks. We find that both of the reverse shock and the forward shock are likely to produce FRBs via synchrotron maser mechanism. We show that this system can in principle sufficiently produce highly active FRBs with a long lifetime, and also can naturally explain the periodicity and the duty cycle of the activity as appeared in FRBs 180916 and 121102. The radio nebula excited by the long-term injection of magnetic blobs into the surrounding environment may account for the associated persistent radio source. In addiction, we discuss the possible multi-wavelength counterparts of FRB 180916 in the context of this model.

arXiv:2102.06138,Navin Sridhar et al.,Periodic Fast Radio Bursts from Luminous X-ray Binaries,"The discovery of periodicity in the arrival times of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) poses a challenge to the oft-studied magnetar scenarios. However, models that postulate that FRBs result from magnetized shocks or magnetic reconnection in a relativistic outflow are not specific to magnetar engines; instead, they require only the impulsive injection of relativistic energy into a dense magnetized medium. Motivated thus, we outline a new scenario in which FRBs are powered by short-lived relativistic outflows (``flares'') from accreting black holes or neutron stars, which propagate into the cavity of the pre-existing (``quiescent'') jet. In order to reproduce FRB luminosities and rates, we are driven to consider binaries of stellar-mass compact objects undergoing super-Eddington mass-transfer, similar to ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources. Indeed, the host galaxies of FRBs, and their spatial offsets within their hosts, show broad similarities with ULXs. Periodicity on timescales of days to years could be attributed to precession (e.g., Lens-Thirring) of the polar accretion funnel, along which the FRB emission is geometrically and relativistically beamed, which sweeps across the observer line of sight. Accounting for the most luminous FRBs via accretion power may require a population of binaries undergoing brief-lived phases of unstable (dynamical-timescale) mass-transfer. This will lead to secular evolution in the properties of some repeating FRBs on timescales of months to years, followed by a transient optical/IR counterpart akin to a luminous red nova, or a more luminous accretion-powered optical/X-ray transient. We encourage targeted FRB searches of known ULX sources.",astro-ph.HE

The study of repeating FRBs may provide useful information about their nature due to their redetectability. The two most famous repeating sources are FRBs 121102 and 180916, with a period of 157 days and 16.35 days, respectively. Previous studies suggest that the periodicity of FRBs is likely associated with neutron star (NS) binary systems. Here we introduce a new model which proposes that periodic repeating FRBs are due to the interaction of a NS with its planet in a highly elliptical orbit. The periastron of the planet is very close to the NS so that it would be partially disrupted by tidal force every time it passes through the periastron. Fragments generated in the process could interact with the compact star through the Alfv\'{e}n wing mechanism and produce FRBs. The model can naturally explain the repeatability of FRBs with a period ranging from a few days to several hundred days, but it generally requires that the eccentricity of the planet's orbit should be large enough. Taking FRBs 121102 and 180916 as examples, it is shown that the main features of the observed repeating behaviors can be satisfactorily accounted for.",astro-ph.HE

Sensitive searches for LIV using astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and pulsars are discussed.

A detailed representation of how to obtain a combined severe limit on the photon mass using fast radio bursts at different redshifts through the dispersion method is presented.

In the past years, one has to use the simulated FRBs with ""known"" redshifts instead. To simulate an FRB, one should randomly assign a redshift to it from a given redshift distribution. But the actual redshift distribution of FRBs is still unknown so far. Therefore, many redshift distributions have been assumed in the literature. In the present work, we study the effect of various redshift distributions on cosmological constraints, while they are treated equally. We find that different redshift distributions lead to different cosmological constraining abilities from the simulated FRBs.

The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation can be used to constrain the reionisation history. Here we propose a CMB-independent method using fast radio bursts (FRBs) to directly measure the ionisation fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as a function of redshift. FRBs are new astronomical transients with millisecond timescales. Their dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm IGM}$) is an indicator of the amount of ionised material in the IGM. Since the differential of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ against redshift is proportional to the ionisation fraction, our method allows us to directly measure the reionisation history without any assumption on its functional shape. As a proof of concept, we constructed mock non-repeating FRB sources to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, assuming three different reionisation histories with the same optical depth of Thomson scattering. We considered three cases of redshift measurements: (A) spectroscopic redshift for all mock data, (B) spectroscopic redshift for 10% of mock data, and (C) redshift estimated from an empirical relation of FRBs between their time-integrated luminosity and rest-frame intrinsic duration. In all cases, the reionisation histories are consistently reconstructed from the mock FRB data using our method.

Our results offer a significant increase in both accuracy and precision beyond those previously obtained. Using results from ASKAP and Parkes, we present our best-fit FRB population parameters in a companion paper. Here, we consider in detail the expected and fitted distributions in redshift, dispersion measure, and signal-to-noise. We estimate that the unlocalised ASKAP FRBs arise from $z<0.5$, with between a third and a half within $z<0.1$. Our predicted source-counts (""logN--logS"") distribution confirms previous indications of a steepening index near the Parkes detection threshold of $1$\,Jy\,ms. We find no evidence for a minimum FRB energy, and rule out $E_{\rm min} > 10^{38.5}$\,erg at 90\% C.L. Importantly, we find that above a certain DM, observational biases cause the Macquart (DM--z) relation to become inverted, implying that the highest-DM events detected in the unlocalised Parkes and ASKAP samples are unlikely to be the most distant. We do not expect our quantitative estimates in this region to be accurate until it is directly probed with localised FRBs.

Our fitted parameters demonstrate that the FRB population evolves with redshift in a manner consistent with, or faster than, the star-formation rate (SFR), ruling out a non-evolving population at 99.9\% C.L.

In this paper, we show how altitude-dependent radio emission from magnetar curvature radiation, with bursts emitted from regions which are asymmetric with respect to the magnetic dipole axis, can lead to burst activity windows and polarization consistent with the recent observations. In particular, the fact that bursts arrive systematically earlier at higher frequencies disfavors theories where the FRB periodicity arises from forced precession of a magnetar by a companion or fallback disk, but is consistent with theories where periodicity originates from a slowly-rotating or freely-precessing magnetar.

The relative contributions of these different media depend on their geometric configuration and the internal properties of the gas. When these relative contributions are well understood, FRB scattering is a powerful probe of density fluctuations along the line-of-sight. The precise scattering measurements for FRB 121102 and FRB 180916 allow us to place an upper limit on the amount of scattering contributed by the Milky Way halo to these FRBs. The scattering time $\tau\propto(\tilde{F} \times {\rm DM}^2) A_\tau$, where ${\rm DM}$ is the dispersion measure, $\tilde{F}$ quantifies electron density variations with $\tilde{F}=0$ for a smooth medium, and the dimensionless constant $A_\tau$ quantifies the difference between the mean scattering delay and the $1/e$ scattering time typically measured. A likelihood analysis of the observed scattering and halo DM constraints finds that $\tilde{F}$ is at least an order of magnitude smaller in the halo than in the Galactic disk. The maximum pulse broadening from the halo is $\tau\lesssim12$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. We compare our analysis of the Milky Way halo with other galaxy haloes by placing limits on the scattering contributions from haloes intersecting the lines-of-sight to FRB 181112 and FRB 191108.

Here $\alpha$ is the spectral index and $\E33$ is the mean FRB energy in units of $10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across a $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$ band in the FRB rest frame. We have considered several different FRB energy distributions, and also different scenarios for the scattering pulse broadening, the event rate density variation with $z$ and the host dispersion measure. We find that in all cases, the common allowed region includes the range $-3.9\leq\alpha\leq-1.3$ and $0.42\leq\E33\leq1$. In all case, large values $\alpha > 4$ and $\E33 >60$ are ruled out. Considering the allowed $(\alpha, \E33)$ parameter range, we predict that CHIME is unlikely to detect an FRB with extra-galactic dispersion measure $(DM_{Ex})$ exceeding $3700\,{\rm pc\,cm}^{-3}$. A substantially larger $DM_{Ex}$ in the large FRB sample anticipated from CHIME would falsify the assumptions of the present analysis. Our analysis is expected to yield tighter parameter constraints with the advent of more FRB data.",astro-ph.HE

Their dispersion measure is indicative of the baryon content in the ionized intergalactic medium between the source and the observer. However, inference using unlocalized fast radio bursts is degenerate to the distribution of redshifts of host galaxies. Method: We perform a joint inference of the intergalactic baryon content and the fast radio burst redshift distribution with the use of Bayesian statistics by comparing the likelihood of different models to reproduce the observed statistics in order to infer the most likely models. In addition to two models of the intergalactic medium, we consider contributions from the local environment of the source, assumed to be a magnetar, as well as a representative ensemble of host and intervening galaxies. Results: Assuming that the missing baryons reside in the ionized intergalactic medium, our results suggest that the redshift distribution of observed fast radio bursts peaks at $z \lesssim 0.6$. However, conclusions from different instruments regarding the intergalactic baryon content diverge and thus require additional changes to the observed distribution of host redshifts, beyond those caused by telescope selection effects.",astro-ph.CO

We jointly model their DM distributions, exploiting the fact that the telescopes have different survey fluence limits but likely sample the same underlying population. After accounting for the effects of instrumental temporal and spectral resolution of each sample, we find that a fit between the modelled and observed DM distribution, using identical population parameters, provides a good fit to both distributions. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between DM and redshift for an homogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM), we determine the best-fit parameters of the population spectral index, $\hat{\alpha}$, and the power-law index of the burst energy distribution, $\hat{\gamma}$, for different redshift evolutionary models. Whilst the overall best-fit model yields $\hat{\alpha}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$ and $\hat{\gamma}=2.0_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$, for a strong redshift evolutionary model, when we admit the further constraint of $\alpha=1.5$ we favour the best fit $\hat{\gamma}=1.5 \pm 0.2$ and the case of no redshift evolution. Moreover, we find no evidence that the FRB population evolves faster than linearly with respect to the star formation rate over the DM (redshift) range for the sampled population.",astro-ph.CO

Repeating FRBs offer better opportunity than non-repeating FRBs since their simultaneous multi-wavelength counterparts might be identified. The magnetar flare model of FRBs is one of the most promising models which predicts high energy emission in addition to radio burst emission. To investigate such a possibility, we have searched for simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous short-term hard X-ray bursts in all the Swift/BAT event mode data which covered the periods when fast radio bursts were reported detections in the repeating FRB 121102, by making use of BAT's arcmin level spacial resolution and wide field-of-view. We did not find any significant hard X-ray bursts which occurred simultaneously to those radio bursts. We also investigated potential short X-ray bursts occurred quasi-simultaneous with those radio bursts (occurrence time differs in the range from hundreds of seconds to thousands of seconds) and concluded that even the best candidates are consistent with background fluctuations. Therefore our investigation concluded that there were no hard X-ray bursts detectable with Swift/BAT which occurred simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously with those fast radio bursts in the repeating FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE

Some of this terrestrial RFI is impulsive and bright, and relatively easy to identify and remove. Other anthropogenic signals, however, are weaker yet periodic, and their persistence can drown out astrophysical signals. Here we show that Fourier-domain excision of periodic RFI is an effective and powerful step in detecting weak cosmic signals. We find that applying the method significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio of transient as well as periodic pulsar signals. In live studies, we detected single pulses from pulsars and FRBs that would otherwise have remained buried in background noise. We show the method has no negative effects on pulsar pulse shape and that it enhances timing campaigns. We demonstrate the method on real-life data from a number of large radio telescopes, and conclude that Fourier-domain RFI excision increases the effective sensitivity to astrophysical sources by a significant fraction which can be even larger than an order of magnitude in case of strong RFI. An accelerated implementation of the method runs on standard time-domain radio data formats and is publicly available.",astro-ph.HE

We quantify their spatial distributions and locations with respect to their host galaxy light distributions, finding that they occur at moderate host normalized-offsets of 1.4 $r_e$ ([0.6,2.1] $r_e$; 68% interval), occur on fainter regions of their hosts in terms of IR light, but overall trace the radial distribution of IR light in their galaxies. The FRBs in our tested distribution do not clearly trace the distributions of any other transient population with known progenitors, and are statistically distinct from the locations of LGRBs, H-poor SLSNe, SGRBs, and Ca-rich transients. We further find that most FRBs are not in regions of elevated local star formation rate and stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of their hosts. We also place upper limits to the IR flux at the FRB positions of $m_{\rm IR}\gtrsim\!24.8-27.6$~AB~mag, constraining both satellite and background galaxies to luminosities well below the host luminosity of FRB121102. We find that 5/8 FRB hosts exhibit clear spiral arm features in IR light, and that the positions of all well-localized FRBs located in such hosts are consistent with their spiral arms, although not on their brightest regions. Our results do not strongly support the primary progenitor channel of FRBs being connected either with the most massive (stripped-envelope) stars, or with events which require kicks and long delay times (neutron star mergers).",astro-ph.GA

While a wide range of models remain viable, the central engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts. Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo, which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight.

arXiv:2012.09495,Runna Wang et al.,Origin of Strong Linear Polarization from Fast Radio Bursts,"The detection of almost 100% linearly polarized emission from the fast radio burst source FRB 121102 implies coherent emission of relativistic electrons moving in perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The origin of such a particle distribution is very intriguing. Given that FRB 121102 is likely driven by a neutron star, we explored orbits of charged particles trapped in a dipole magnetic field (the St\""ormer problem). Most previous studies focused on particles with relatively low energies so that the guiding center approximation may be applied. High energy particles usually have chaotic orbits except those on a periodic orbit or near stable periodic orbits. Via evaluation of the maximum Lyapunov exponent of orbits of particles launched from the equatorial plane with an axial velocity (the angular velocity sets the length and energy scales of the system), we found prominent regions of quasi-periodic orbits around stable periodic orbits in the equatorial plane at high-energies. Particles in these orbits oscillate around the equatorial plane and their radial distance from the dipole can vary by a factor of/,2. Relativistic electrons in such orbits may be responsible for the almost 100% polarized emission from FRB 121102.",hep-ph
arXiv:2012.08372,Z. Pleunis et al.,LOFAR Detection of 110-188 MHz Emission and Frequency-Dependent Activity from FRB 20180916B,"FRB 20180916B is a well-studied repeating fast radio burst source. Its proximity (~150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, have revealed many clues about its nature -- including a 16.3-day periodicity in its activity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110-188 MHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are seen down to the lowest-observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their spectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude stronger constraint on the optical depth due to free-free absorption in the source's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly flat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at 300-1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths (~40-160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due to scattering. We find ~2-3 rad/m^2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure that may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the LOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly detected bursts from the uGMRT (200-450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400-800 MHz). Simultaneous observations show 5 CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected by LOFAR. We find that the burst activity is systematically delayed towards lower frequencies by ~3 days from 600 MHz to 150 MHz. We discuss these results in the context of a model in which FRB 20180916B is an interacting binary system featuring a neutron star and high-mass stellar companion.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2012.08348,InÃ©s Pastor-Marazuela et al.,Chromatic periodic activity down to 120 MHz in a Fast Radio Burst,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients whose brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic, yet compact enough to produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been detected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained elusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB 20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif and LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its activity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind interaction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower frequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For bursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at 1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB rate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at 90% confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds cause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.",astro-ph.HE

To explore possible relations between them, we study the cumulative energy distributions of these two phenomena using the observations of repeating FRB 121102 and the GPs of Crab pulsar. We find that the power-law slope of GPs (with fluence $\geq$130 Jy ms) is $2.85\pm0.10$. The energy distribution of FRB 121102 can be well fitted by a smooth broken power-law function. For the bursts of FRB 121102 above the break energy (1.22 $\times 10^{37}$ erg), the best-fitting slope is $2.90_{-0.44}^{+0.55}$, similar to the index of GPs at the same observing frequency ($\sim$1.4 GHz). We further discuss the physical origin of the repeating FRB 121102 in the framework of the super GPs model. And we find that the super GPs model involving a millisecond pulsar is workable and favored for explaining FRB 121102 despite that the magnetar burst model is more popular.",astro-ph.HE

The observational challenges following from their fleeting, generally one-off nature have prevented identification of the underlying sources producing the bursts. As the population of detected FRBs grows, the observed distributions of brightness, pulse width and dispersion measure now begin to take shape. Meaningful direct interpretation of these distributions is, however, made impossible by the selection effects that telescope and search pipelines invariably imprint on each FRB survey. Here we show that multi-dimensional FRB population synthesis can find a single, self-consistent population of FRB sources that can reproduce the real-life results of the major ongoing FRB surveys. This means that individual observed distributions can now be combined to derive the properties of the intrinsic FRB source population. The characteristics of our best-fit model for one-off FRBs agree with a population of magnetars. We extrapolate this model and predict the number of FRBs future surveys will find. For surveys that have commenced, the method we present here can already determine the composition of the FRB source class, and potentially even its subpopulations.",astro-ph.HE

However, the transient nature of FRBs presents various challenges, e.g. in system design, raw compute power and real-time communication, where the real-time requirements are reasonably strict (a few tens of seconds). Rapid data processing is essential for us to be able to retain high-resolution data of the bursts, to localise them, and to minimise the delay for follow-up observations.

arXiv:2012.02460,D. W. Gardenier et al.,Synthesizing the repeating FRB population using frbpoppy,"The observed Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population can be divided into one-off and repeating FRB sources. Either this division is a true dichotomy of the underlying sources, or selection effects and low activity prohibit us from observing repeat pulses from all constituents making up the FRB source population. We attempt to break this degeneracy through FRB population synthesis. With that aim we extend frbpoppy, which earlier only handled one-off FRBs, to also simulate repeaters. We next model the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB survey (CHIME/FRB). Using this implementation, we investigate the impact of luminosity functions on the observed dispersion measure (DM) and distance distributions of both repeating and one-off FRBs. We show that for a single, intrinsically repeating source population with a steep luminosity function, selection effects should shape the DM distributions of one-off and repeating FRB sources differently. This difference is not yet observed. We next show how the repeater fraction over time can help in determining the repetition rate of an intrinsic source population. We simulate this fraction for CHIME/FRB, and show that a source population comprised solely of repeating FRBs can describe CHIME/FRB observations with the use of a flat luminosity function. From the outcome of these two methods we thus conclude that all FRBs originate from a single and mostly uniform population of varying repeaters. Within this population, the luminosity function cannot be steep, and there must be minor differences in physical or behaviour parameters that correlate with repeat rate.",astro-ph.HE

Of those four sources, three have detected periods ranging from 220 ms to 2.726 s. Three sources have more persistent but still intermittent emission and are likely intermittent or nulling pulsars.

These effects could lead to the emission of fast radio bursts (FRBs), for example by asteroid-induced magnetic wake fields in the wind of the compact object. A few percent of binary neutron star systems in the Universe, such as neutron star-main sequence star, neutron star-white dwarf, double neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems, can account for the observed non-repeating FRB rates. More remarkably, we find that wide and close companion orbits lead to non-repeating and repeating sources, respectively, and they allow for one to compute a ratio between repeating and non-repeating sources of a few percent, which is in close agreement with the observations. Three major predictions can be made from our scenario, which can be tested in the coming years: 1) most repeaters should stop repeating after a period between 10 years to a few decades, as their asteroid belts become depleted; 2) some non-repeaters could occasionally repeat, if we hit the short period tail of the FRB period distribution; and 3) series of sub-Jansky level short radio bursts could be observed as electromagnetic counterparts of the mergers of binary neutron star systems.",astro-ph.HE

Batten et al.,The Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the EAGLE Simulations,"The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique way to probe ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Cosmological models with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and the circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies lead to scatter around the mean $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relations. We have used the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to measure the mean $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation and the scatter around it using over one billion lines-of-sight between redshifts $0<z<3$. We investigated two techniques to estimate line-of-sight DM: `pixel scrambling' and `box transformations'. We find that using box transformations (a technique from the literature) causes strong correlations due to repeated replication of structure. Comparing a linear and non-linear model, we find that the non-linear model with cosmological parameters, provides a better fit to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation. The differences between these models are the most significant at low redshifts ($z<0.5$). The scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation is highly asymmetric, especially at low redshift $\left(z<0.5\right)$, and becomes more Gaussian as redshift approaches $z\sim3$, the limit of this study. The increase in Gaussianity with redshift is indicative of the large scale structures that is better probed with longer lines-of-sight. The minimum simulation size suitable for investigations into the scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation is 100~comoving~Mpc. The $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation measured in EAGLE is available with an easy-to-use python interface in the open-source FRB redshift estimation package FRUITBAT.",astro-ph.CO

Zhang et al.,Intergalactic medium dispersion measures of fast radio bursts estimated from IllustrisTNG simulation and their cosmological applications,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients and can be used as a cosmological probe. However, the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by intergalactic medium (IGM) is hard to be distinguished from other components. In this paper, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation to realistically estimate the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ up to $z\sim 9$. We find $DM_{\rm IGM} = 892^{+721}_{-270}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ at $z=1$. The probability distribution of $DM_{\rm IGM}$ can be well fitted by a quasi-Gaussian function with a long tail. The tail is caused by the structures along the line of sight in IGM. Subtracting DM contributions from the Milky Way and host galaxy for localized FRBs, the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ value is close to the derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation. We also show the capability to constrain the cosmic reionization history with the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs in the IllustrisTNG universe. The derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation at high redshifts can be well fitted by a $tanh$ reionization model with the reionization redshift $z=5.95$, which is compatible with the reionization model used by the IllustrisTNG simulation. The $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs also provides an independent way to measure the optical depth of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our result can be used to derive the pseudo-redshifts of non-localized FRBs for $DM_{\rm IGM}<4000$ \ \ pc cm$^{-3}$.",astro-ph.CO

Ferrigno et al.,Multi-messenger astronomy with INTEGRAL,"At the time of defining the science objectives of the INTernational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), such a rapid and spectacular development of multi-messenger astronomy could not have been predicted, with new impulsive phenomena becoming accessible through different channels.   Neutrino telescopes have routinely detected energetic neutrino events coming from unknown cosmic sources since 2013. Gravitational wave detectors opened a novel window on the sky in 2015 with the detection of the merging of two black holes and in 2017 with the merging of two neutron stars, followed by signals in the full electromagnetic range. Finally, since 2007, radio telescopes detected extremely intense and short burst of radio waves, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) whose origin is for most cases extragalactic, but enigmatic.   The exceptionally robust and versatile design of the INTEGRAL mission has allowed researchers to exploit data collected not only with the pointed instruments, but also with the active cosmic-ray shields of the main instruments to detect impulses of gamma-rays in coincidence with unpredictable phenomena. The full-sky coverage, mostly unocculted by the Earth, the large effective area, the stable background, and the high duty cycle (85%) put INTEGRAL in a privileged position to give a major contribution to multi-messenger astronomy.   In this review, we describe how INTEGRAL has provided upper limits on the gamma-ray emission from black-hole binary mergers, detected a short gamma-ray burst in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger, contributed to define the spectral energy distribution of a blazar associated with a neutrino event, set upper limits on impulsive and steady gamma-ray emission from cosmological FRBs, and detected a magnetar flare associated with fast radio bursting emission.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2011.11643,Paz Beniamini et al.,Exploring the epoch of hydrogen reionization using FRBs,"We describe three different methods for exploring the hydrogen reionization epoch using fast radio bursts (FRBs) and provide arguments for the existence of FRBs at high redshift (z). The simplest way, observationally, is to determine the maximum dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm max}$) of FRBs for an ensemble that includes bursts during the reionization. The DM$_{\rm max}$ provides information regarding reionization much like the optical depth of the CMB to Thomson scattering does, and it has the potential to be more accurate than constraints from Planck, if DM$_{\rm max}$ can be measured to a precision better than 500 $\mbox{pc cm}^{-3}$. Another method is to measure redshifts of about 40 FRBs between z of 6-10 with$\sim10\%$ accuracy to obtain the average electron density in 4 different z-bins with $\sim4\%$ accuracy. These two methods don't require knowledge of the FRB luminosity function and its possible redshift evolution. Finally, we show that the reionization history is reflected in the number of FRBs per unit DM, given a fluence limited survey of FRBs that includes bursts during the reionization epoch; we show using FIRE simulations that the contributions to DM from the FRB host galaxy $\&$ CGM during the reionization era is a small fraction of the observed DM. This third method requires no redshift information but does require knowledge of the FRB luminosity function.",astro-ph.CO

One method to achieve end-to-end testing of the system is by injecting mock FRBs in the live data-stream and searching for them blindly. Mock FRB injection is particularly effective for machine-learning-based classifiers, for which analytic characterisation is impractical. We describe a first-of-its-kind implementation of a real-time mock FRB injection system at the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) and present our results for a set of 20,000 mock FRB injections. The injections have yielded clear insight into the detection efficiencies and have provided a survey completeness function for pulse width, fluence and DM. Mock FRBs are recovered with uniform efficiency over the full range of injected DMs, however the recovery fraction is found to be a strong function of the width and Signal-to-Noise (SNR). For low widths ($\lesssim 20$ ms) and high SNR ($\gtrsim$ 9) the recovery is highly effective with recovery fractions exceeding 90%. We find that the presence of radio frequency interference causes the recovered SNR values to be systematically lower by up to 20% compared to the injected values. We find that wider FRBs become increasingly hard to recover for the machine-learning-based classifier employed at UTMOST. We encourage other observatories to implement live injection set-ups for similar testing of their surveys.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:2011.09921,"Bing Zhang, ","""Slow"" Radio Bursts from Galactic Magnetars?","Recently, one fast radio burst, FRB 200428, was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason for such rarity of FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly beamed than the SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is correct, one would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angles somewhat outside the narrow emission beam. These ""slow"" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. We derive two ""closure relations"" to judge whether a long, less luminous radio burst could be an SRB. The 2.2-s, 308 Jy ms, 111 MHz radio burst detected from SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB. The 2-ms, 60 mJy ms faint burst detected by FAST from the same source could be also an SRB if the corresponding FRB has a narrow spectrum. If the FRB beam is narrow, there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. The lack of detection of abundant SRBs from magnetars would disfavor the hypothesis that all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Beloborodov, ",Emission of magnetar bursts and precursors of neutron star mergers,"Magnetar bursts can be emitted by Alfv\'en waves growing in the outer magnetosphere to nonlinear amplitudes, $\delta B/B\sim 1$, and triggering magnetic reconnection. Similar magnetic flares should occur quasi-periodically in a magnetized neutron star binary nearing merger. In both cases, fast dissipation in the magnetic flare creates optically thick $e^\pm$ plasma, whose heat capacity is negligible compared with the generated radiation energy. Magnetic dissipation then involves photon viscosity and acts through Compton drag on the plasma bulk motions in the reconnection region. The effective temperature of the resulting Comptonization process is self-regulated to tens of keV. The generated X-ray emission is calculated using time-dependent radiative transfer simulations, which follow the creation of $e^\pm$ pairs and the production, Comptonization, and escape of photons. The simulations show how the dissipation region becomes dressed in an $e^\pm$ coat, and how the escaping spectrum is shaped by radiative transfer through the coat. The results are compared with observed magnetar bursts, including the recent activity of SGR 1935+2154 accompanied by a fast radio burst.

The magnetar was observed in a period of intense X-ray bursting activity and enhanced X-ray emission. We report here on the detection of two radio bursts from 1E1547.0-5408, reminiscent of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). One of the radio bursts was anticipated by ~1s (about half a rotation period of the pulsar) by a bright SGR-like X-ray burst, resulting in a F_radio/F_X ~ 10^-9. Radio pulsations were not detected during the observation showing the FRB-like radio bursts, while they were detected in the previous radio observation. We also found that the two radio bursts are neither aligned with the latter radio pulsations nor with the peak of the X-ray pulse profile (phase shift of ~0.2). Comparing the luminosity of these FRB-like bursts and those reported from SGR1935+2154, we find that the wide range in radio efficiency and/or luminosity of magnetar bursts in the Galaxy may bridge the gap between ""ordinary"" pulsar radio bursts and the extragalactic FRB phenomenon.",astro-ph.HE

Their isotropic energies follow a power-law distribution with a possible exponential cutoff, but their intrinsic redshift distribution, which contains information about the FRB sources, is not well understood. We attempt to constrain both distributions by means of Monte Carlo simulations and comparing the simulations results with the available FRB specific fluence distribution, dispersion measure (DM) distribution, and the estimated energy distribution data. Two redshift distribution models, one tracking the star formation history of the universe and another tracking compact binary mergers, are tested. For the latter model, we consider three merger delay timescale distribution (Gaussian, log-normal, and power law) models. Two FRB samples detected by Parkes and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), respectively, are used to confront the simulation results. We confirm the $\sim -1.8$ power law index for the energy distribution but the exponential cutoff energy of the distribution, if any, is unconstrained. For the best energy distribution model, none of the redshift distributions we considered are rejected by the data. A future, larger, uniform FRB sample (such as the one collected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, CHIME) can provide better constraints on the intrinsic FRB redshift distribution using the methodology presented in this paper.",astro-ph.HE

Here we discuss circularly polarised emissions produced by propagation effects in the magnetosphere of fast spinning magnetars. We argue that the polarisation-limiting region is well beyond the light cylinder, suggesting that wave mode coupling effects are unlikely to produce strong circular polarisation for fast spinning magnetars. Cyclotron absorption could be significant if the secondary plasma density is high. However, high degrees of circular polarisation can only be produced with large asymmetries in electrons and positrons. We draw attention to the non-detection of circular polarisation in current observations of known repeating FRBs. We suggest that the circular polarisation of FRBs could provide key information on their origins and help distinguish different radiation mechanisms.",astro-ph.HE

The high frame rate allows detection of sub-second transients over multiple images. We present a sample of ~0.1--0.3s duration flares detected in an un-targeted survey for such transients. We show that most, if not all of them, are glints of sunlight reflected off geosynchronous and graveyard orbit satellites. The flares we detect have a typical magnitude of 9--11, which translates to ~14--16th magnitude if diluted by a 30s exposure time. We estimate the rate of events brighter than ~11mag to be on the order of 30--40 events per day per deg^2, for declinations between -20 and +10^\circ, not including the declination corresponding to the geostationary belt directly above the equator, where the rate can be higher. We show that such glints are common in large area surveys (e.g., ZTF and LSST), and that some of them have a point-like appearance, confounding searches for fast transients such as Fast Radio Burst counterparts and Gamma-ray bursts. By observing in the direction of the Earth's shadow we are able to put an upper limit on the rate of fast astrophysical transients of 0.052deg^{-2}day^{-1} (95\% confidence limit) for events brighter than 11mag. We also suggest that the single image, high declination flare observed in coincidence with the GN-z11 galaxy and assumed to be a Gamma-ray burst, is also consistent with such a satellite glint.",astro-ph.IM

The source also exhibits a 16.35-day period in its bursting. Here we present optical and infrared imaging as well as integral field spectroscopy observations of FRB 20180916B with the WFC3 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope and the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The 60-90 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution of the Hubble imaging, along with the previous 2.3-mas localization of FRB 20180916B, allow us to probe its environment with a 30-60 pc resolution. We constrain any point-like star-formation or HII region at the location of FRB 20180916B to have an H$\alpha$ luminosity $L_\mathrm{H\alpha} \lesssim 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and, correspondingly, constrain the local star-formation rate to be $\lesssim10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The constraint on H$\alpha$ suggests that possible stellar companions to FRB 20180916B should be of a cooler, less massive spectral type than O6V. FRB 20180916B is 250 pc away (in projected distance) from the brightest pixel of the nearest young stellar clump, which is $\sim380$\,pc in size (full-width at half maximum). With the typical projected velocities of pulsars, magnetars, or neutron stars in binaries (60-750 km s$^{-1}$), FRB 20180916B would need 800 kyr to 7 Myr to traverse the observed distance from its presumed birth site. This timescale is inconsistent with the active ages of magnetars ($\lesssim10$ kyr). Rather, the inferred age and observed separation are compatible with the ages of high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray binaries, and their separations from the nearest OB associations.",astro-ph.HE

Reflections have historically caused false alarms for transient surveys, but the population has not been systematically studied. We report event rates for these orbital flashes using the Evryscope Fast Transient Engine, a low-latency transient detection pipeline for the Evryscopes. We select single-epoch detections likely caused by Earth satellites and model the event rate as a function of both magnitude and sky position. We measure a rate of $1800^{+600}_{-280}$ sky$^{-1}$ hour$^{-1}$, peaking at $m_g = 13.0$, for flashes morphologically degenerate with real astrophysical signals in surveys like the Evryscopes. Of these, $340^{+150}_{-85}$ sky$^{-1}$ hour$^{-1}$ are bright enough to be visible to the naked eye in typical suburban skies with a visual limiting magnitude of $V\approx4$. These measurements place the event rate of orbital flashes orders of magnitude higher than the combined rate of public alerts from all active all-sky fast-timescale transient searches, including neutrino, gravitational-wave, gamma-ray, and radio observatories. Short-timescale orbital flashes form a dominating foreground for un-triggered searches for fast transients in low-resolution, wide-angle surveys. However, events like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with arcminute-scale localization have a low probability ($\sim10^{-5}$) of coincidence with an orbital flash, allowing optical surveys to place constraints on their potential optical counterparts in single images. Upcoming satellite internet constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, are unlikely to contribute significantly to the population of orbital flashes in normal operations.",astro-ph.HE

They are subsequently identified, for the most part, as emanating from unknown objects at cosmological distances. At present, over one hundred FRBs have been verified, classified into two groups: repeating bursts (20 samples) and apparently non-repeating bursts (91 samples). Their origins, however, are still hotly debated. Here,we investigate the statistical classifications for the two groups of samples to see if the non-repeating and repeating FRBs have different origins by employing Anderson-Darling (A-D) test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (M-W-W) test. Firstly, by taking the pulse width as a statistical variant, we found that the repeating samples do not follow the Gaussian statistics (may belong to a chi-square distribution), although the overall data and non-repeating group do follow the Gaussian. Meanwhile, to investigate the statistical differences between the two groups, we turn to M-W-W test and notice that the two distributions have different origins. Secondly, we consider the FRB radio luminosity as a statistical variant, and find that both groups of samples can be regarded as the Gaussian distributions under the A-D test, although they have different origins according to M-W-W tests. Therefore, statistically, we can conclude that our classifications of both repeaters and non-repeaters are plausible, that the two FRB classes have different origins, or each has experienced distinctive phases or been subject to its own physical processes.",astro-ph.HE

Two possible mechanisms that could generate extremely coherent emission from FRBs invoke neutron star magnetospheres or relativistic shocks far from the central energy source. Detailed polarization observations may help us to understand the emission mechanism. However, the available FRB polarization data have been perplexing, because they show a host of polarimetric properties, including either a constant polarization angle during each burst for some repeaters or variable polarization angles in some other apparently one-off events. Here we report observations of 15 bursts from FRB 180301 and find various polarization angle swings in seven of them. The diversity of the polarization angle features of these bursts is consistent with a magnetospheric origin of the radio emission, and disfavours the radiation models invoking relativistic shocks.",astro-ph.HE

Chen et al.,Relativistic AlfvÃ©n Waves Entering Charge Starvation in the Magnetospheres of Neutron Stars,"Instabilities in a neutron star can generate Alfv\'en waves in its magnetosphere. Propagation along the curved magnetic field lines strongly shears the wave, boosting its electric current $j_{\rm A}$. We derive an analytic expression for the evolution of the wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ and the growth of $j_{\rm A}$. In the strongly sheared regime, $j_{\rm A}$ may exceed the maximum current $j_{0}$ that can be supported by the background $e^{\pm}$ plasma. We investigate these ""charge-starved"" waves, first using a simplified two-fluid analytic model, then with first-principles kinetic simulations. We find that the Alfv\'en wave continues to propagate successfully even when $\kappa \equiv j_{\rm A}/j_{0} \gg 1$. It sustains $j_{\rm A}$ by compressing and advecting the plasma along the magnetic field lines with particle Lorentz factors $\sim \kappa^{1/2}$. The simulations show how plasma instabilities lead to gradual dissipation of the wave energy, giving a dissipation power $L_{\rm diss}\sim 10^{35}(\kappa/100)^{1/2} (B_w/10^{11}\,{\rm G})\,\mathrm{erg/s}$, where $B_w$ is the wave amplitude.

With these tools, we reanalyze the highest frequency 4-8 GHz data of Gajjar et al. (2018) for the repeating FRB 20121102A (FRB 121102). In the data we discover, first, a remarkable spectral structure of almost equidistant peaks separated by $95\pm 16$ MHz. We suggest that it can originate from diffractive lensing of the FRB signals on a compact gravitating object of mass $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ or on a plasma underdensity near the source. Second, the spectra include erratic interstellar, presumably Milky Way scintillations. We extract their decorrelation bandwidth $3.3\pm 0.6$ MHz at reference frequency 6 GHz. The third feature is a GHz-scale pattern which, as we find, linearly drifts with time and presumably represents a wide-band propagation effect, e.g. GHz-scale scintillations. Fourth, many spectra are dominated by a narrow peak at 7.1 GHz. We suggest that it can be caused by a propagation through a plasma lens, e.g., in the host galaxy. Fifth, separating the propagation effects, we give strong arguments that the intrinsic progenitor spectrum has narrow GHz bandwidth and variable central frequency.

Assuming the FRB radiation mechanism is synchrotron maser emission from magnetized shocks, we develop a specific scenario by introducing a density jump structure of upstream medium, and thus the double-peaked character of FRB 200428 is a natural outcome. The luminosity and emission frequency of two pulses can be well explained in this scenario. Furthermore, we find that the synchrotron emission of shock-accelerated electrons is in the X-ray band, which therefore can be responsible for at least a portion of observed X-ray fluence. With proper upgrade, this density jump scenario can be potentially applied to FRBs with multiple peaks in the future.",astro-ph.HE

Recent observations indicate that a few repeating FRBs (e.g., FRB 121102) present time--frequency downward drifting patterns and nearly 100$\%$ linear polarization. Following the model of \citet{dai 2016} who proposed that repeating FRBs may originate from a slowly-rotating, old-aged pulsar colliding with an asteroid belt around a stellar-mass object, we focus on the prediction of time--frequency drifting and polarization. In this scenario, the frequency drifting is mainly caused by the geometric structure of a pulsar magnetosphere, and the drifting rate--frequency index is found to be $25/17$. On the other hand, by considering the typical differential mass distribution of incident asteroids, we find that an asteroid with mass $m\gtrsim 10^{17}~{\rm g}$ colliding with the pulsar would contribute abundant gravitational energy, which powers an FRB. A broad frequency band of the FRBs would be expected, due to the mass difference of the incident asteroids. In addition, we simulate the linear polarization distribution for the repeating FRBs, and constrain the linear polarization with $\gtrsim$ 30$\%$ for the FRBs with flux of an order of magnitude lower than the maximum flux.",astro-ph.HE

The repeating FRB121102 is so far the only extra-galactic Fast Radio Burst found to be associated with a counterpart, a steady radio source with a nearly flat spectral energy distribution (SED) in centimeter wavelengths.   Aims. Previous observations of the persistent source down to $1.6$~GHz has shown no sign of a spectral turn-over. Absorption is expected to eventually cause a turn-over at lower frequencies. Better constraints on the physical parameters of the emitting medium can be derived by detecting the self-absorption frequency.   Methods. We used the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) during the period of July to December 2017 to observe the source at low radio frequencies down to $400$~MHz.   Results. The spectral energy distribution of the source remains optically thin even at $400$~MHz, with a spectral index of $\nu^{-(0.07 \pm 0.03)}$ similar to what is seen in Galactic plerions. Using a generic synchrotron radiation model, we obtain constraints on properties of the non-thermal plasma and the central engine powering it.   Conclusions. We present low-frequency detections of the persistent source associated with FRB121102. Its characteristic flat SED extends down to $400$~MHz. Like Galactic plerions, the energy in the persistent source is carried predominantly by leptons. The emitting plasma has a $B< 0.01$~G, and its age is $> 524 \left(\frac{B}{0.01 {\rm G}} \right)^{-3/2}$. We show that the energetics of the persistent source requires an initial spin period shorter than 36~ms, and the magnetic field of the neutron star must exceed $4.5\times 10^{12}$~G. This implies that the persistent source does not necessarily require energetic input from a magnetar.",astro-ph.HE

The relationship between the frequency drift rate, or slope, of individual sub-bursts and their temporal duration is investigated. We consider a broad sample of possible dispersion measure (DM) values for each source to understand the range of valid sub-burst slope and duration measurements for all bursts and to constrain our results. We find good agreement with an inverse scaling law between the two parameters previously predicted using a simple dynamical relativistic model. The remarkably similar behaviour observed in all sources provides strong evidence that a single and common underlying physical phenomenon is responsible for the emission of signals from these three FRBs, despite their associations with different types of host galaxies at various redshifts. It also opens up the possibility that this sub-burst slope law may be a universal property among repeating FRBs, or indicates a distinct subclass among them.",astro-ph.HE

Zhao et al.,Dispersion and Rotation Measures from the Ejecta of Compact Binary Mergers: Clue to the Progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts,"Since the discovery of FRB 200428 associated with the Galactic SGR 1935+2154, magnetars are considered to power fast radio bursts (FRBs). It is widely believed that magnetars could form by core-collapse (CC) explosions and compact binary mergers, such as binary neutron star (BNS), binary white dwarfs (BWD), and neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) mergers. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the various progenitors. The expansion of the merger ejecta produces a time-evolving dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can probe the local environments of FRBs. In this paper, we derive the scaling laws for the DM and RM from ejecta with different dynamical structures (the mass and energy distribution) in the uniform ambient medium (merger scenario) and wind environment (CC scenario). We find that the DM and RM will increase in the early phase, while DM will continue to grow slowly but RM will decrease in the later phase in the merger scenario. We fit the DM and RM evolution of FRB 121102 simultaneously for the first time in the BNS merger scenario, and find the source age is $ \sim9-10 $ yr when it was first detected in 2012, and the ambient medium density is $ \sim 2.5-3.1 $ cm$ ^{-3} $. The large offsets of some FRBs are consistent with BNS/NSWD channel. The population synthesis method is used to estimate the rate of compact binary mergers. The rate of BWD mergers is close to the observed FRB rate. Therefore, the progenitors of FRBs may not be unique.",astro-ph.HE

First, we compare these TRPs with previous observations of normal radio pulses from pulsars and magnetars, and find that the TRPs should be produced by different mechanism from that of normal radio pulses. We then investigate the second question by assuming the TRPs have the same origin as that of periodically repeating FRBs and find that the origin of the periodicity of periodically repeating FRBs should not be induced by precession. Otherwise, we should expect that the TRPs are not an FRB, at least the TRPs don't have the same origin as that of periodically repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2010.08282,Emanuele Sobacchi et al.,Self-modulation of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extreme astrophysical phenomena entering the realm of non-linear optics, a field developed in laser physics. A classical non-linear effect is self-modulation. We examine the propagation of FRBs through the circumburst environment using the idealised setup of a monochromatic linearly-polarised GHz wave propagating through a uniform plasma slab of density $N$ at distance $R$ from the source. We find that self-modulation occurs if the slab is located within a critical radius $R_{\rm crit}\sim 10^{17}(N/10^2{\rm\; cm}^{-3})(L/10^{42}{\rm\; erg\; s}^{-1}){\rm\; cm}$, where $L$ is the isotropic equivalent of the FRB luminosity. Self-modulation breaks the burst into pancakes transverse to the radial direction. When $R\lesssim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes is smaller than the Fresnel scale. The pancakes are strongly diffracted as the burst exits the slab, and interference between the pancakes produces a frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a sub-GHz bandwidth. When $R\sim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes becomes comparable with the Fresnel scale, and the effect of diffraction is weaker. The observed intensity is modulated on a timescale of ten microseconds, which corresponds to the radial width of the pancakes. Our results suggest that self-modulation may cause the temporal and frequency structure observed in FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar currently known ($1.4$ ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW). The remnant spin period $P_{\rm rem}$ inferred from the FRB observation is unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant $M_{\rm rem}$ inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity $P_{\rm rem}/M_{\rm rem}$, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely related to the binary tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$ of NSs before they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on $\Lambda$. Thus, if $\Lambda$ is also well measured by GW data, a comparison between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear matter and BNS mergers.",astro-ph.HE

Michilli et al.,An analysis pipeline for CHIME/FRB full-array baseband data,"The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has become a leading facility for detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) through the CHIME/FRB backend. CHIME/FRB searches for fast transients in polarization-summed intensity data streams that have 24-kHz spectral and 1-ms temporal resolution. The intensity beams are pointed to pre-determined locations in the sky. A triggered baseband system records the coherent electric field measured by each antenna in the CHIME array at the time of FRB detections. Here we describe the analysis techniques and automated pipeline developed to process these full-array baseband data recordings. Whereas the real-time FRB detection pipeline has a localization limit of several arcminutes, offline analysis of baseband data yields source localizations with sub-arcminute precision, as characterized by using a sample of pulsars and one repeating FRB with known positions. The baseband pipeline also enables resolving temporal substructure on a micro-second scale and the study of polarization including detections of Faraday rotation.",astro-ph.HE

Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we observed 43 sources at 6 and 100 GHz on a timescale of $\sim 1 - 19$ yr post-explosion. We do not detect radio/mm emission from any of the sources, with the exception of a 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi (Eftekhari et al. 2019), as well as the detection of 6 GHz emission near the location of the SLSN PTF12dam, which we associate with its host galaxy. We use our data to place constraints on central engine emission due to magnetar wind nebulae and off-axis relativistic jets. We also explore non-relativistic emission from the SN ejecta, and place constraints on obscured star formation in the host galaxies. In addition, we conduct a search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from some of the sources using VLA Phased-Array observations; no FRBs are detected to a limit of $16$ mJy ($7\sigma$; 10 ms duration) in about 40 min on source per event.

Nimmo et al.,Highly polarised microstructure from the repeating FRB 20180916B,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, coherent, short-duration radio transients of as-yet unknown extragalactic origin. FRBs exhibit a wide variety of spectral, temporal and polarimetric properties, which can unveil clues into their emission physics and propagation effects in the local medium. Here we present the high-time-resolution (down to 1 $\mu$s) polarimetric properties of four 1.7-GHz bursts from the repeating FRB 20180916B, which were detected in voltage data during observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN). We observe a range of emission timescales spanning three orders of magnitude, with the shortest component width reaching 3-4 $\mu$s (below which we are limited by scattering). This is the shortest timescale measured in any FRB, to date. We demonstrate that all four bursts are highly linearly polarised ($\gtrsim 80\%$), show no evidence for significant circular polarisation ($\lesssim 15\%$), and exhibit a constant polarisation position angle (PPA) during and between bursts. On short timescales ($\lesssim 100$ $\mu$s), however, there appear to be subtle (few degree) PPA variations across the burst profiles. These observational results are most naturally explained in an FRB model where the emission is magnetospheric in origin, as opposed to models where the emission originates at larger distances in a relativistic shock.",astro-ph.HE

A large number of recently observed pulsars and fast radio bursts in radio astronomy and the prospected increase in sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors suggest that wave effects will likely be observed in the near future. The interference fringes are sensitive to physical parameters which cannot be inferred from geometric optics. In particular, for multi-plane lensing, the pattern depends on the redshifts of the lens planes. I present a new method to define and efficiently evaluate multi-plane lensing of coherent electromagnetic waves by plasmas and gravitational lenses in polynomial time. This method will allow the use of radio and gravitational wave sources to probe our universe in novel ways.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2010.01560,Ryuichi Takahashi et al.,Statistical modelling of the cosmological dispersion measure,"We have investigated the basic statistics of the cosmological dispersion measure (DM) -- such as its mean, variance, probability distribution, angular power spectrum and correlation function -- using the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG300, for the fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. To model the DM statistics, we first measured the free-electron abundance and the power spectrum of its spatial fluctuations. The free-electron power spectrum turns out to be consistent with the dark matter power spectrum at large scales, but it is strongly damped at small scales ($\lesssim 1$Mpc) owing to the stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback. The free-electron power spectrum is well modelled using a scale-dependent bias factor (the ratio of its fluctuation amplitude to that of the dark matter). We provide analytical fitting functions for the free-electron abundance and its bias factor. We next constructed mock sky maps of the DM by performing standard ray-tracing simulations with the TNG300 data. The DM statistics are calculated analytically from the fitting functions of the free-electron distribution, which agree well with the simulation results measured from the mock maps. We have also obtained the probability distribution of source redshift for a given DM, which helps in identifying the host galaxies of FRBs from the measured DMs. The angular two-point correlation function of the DM is described by a simple power law, $\xi(\theta) \approx 2400 (\theta/{\rm deg})^{-1} \, {\rm pc}^2 \, {\rm cm}^{-6}$, which we anticipate will be confirmed by future observations when thousands of FRBs are available.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2010.00617,Clara Dehman et al.,On the rate of crustal failures in young magnetars,"The activity of magnetars is powered by their intense and dynamic magnetic fields and has been proposed as the trigger to extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts. Here we estimate the frequency of crustal failures in young magnetars, by computing the magnetic stresses in detailed magneto-thermal simulations including Hall drift and Ohmic dissipation. The initial internal topology at birth is poorly known but is likely to be much more complex than a dipole. Thus, we explore a wide range of initial configurations, finding that the expected rate of crustal failures varies by orders of magnitude depending on the initial magnetic configuration. Our results show that this rate scales with the crustal magnetic energy, rather than with the often used surface value of the dipolar component related to the spin-down torque. The estimated frequency of crustal failures for a given dipolar component can vary by orders of magnitude for different initial conditions, depending on how much magnetic energy is distributed in the crustal non-dipolar components, likely dominant in newborn magnetars. The quantitative reliability of the expected event rate could be improved by a better treatment of the magnetic evolution in the core and the elastic/plastic crustal response, here not included. Regardless of that, our results are useful inputs in modelling the outburst rate of young Galactic magnetars, and their relation with the Fast Radio Bursts in our and other galaxies.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2009.14042,G. H. Hilmarsson et al.,Observing superluminous supernovae and long gamma ray bursts as potential birthplaces of repeating fast radio bursts,"Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) have been proposed as progenitors of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this scenario, bursts originate from the interaction between a young magnetar and its surrounding supernova remnant (SNR). Such a model could explain the repeating, apparently non-Poissonian nature of FRB121102, which appears to display quiescent and active phases. This bursting behaviour is better explained with a Weibull distribution, which includes parametrisation for clustering. We observed 10 SLSNe/LGRBs for 63 hours, looking for repeating FRBs with the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope, but have not detected any bursts. We scale the burst rate of FRB121102 to an FRB121102-like source inhabiting each of our observed targets, and compare this rate to our upper burst rate limit on a source by source basis. By adopting a fiducial beaming fraction of 0.6, we obtain 99.99\% and 83.4\% probabilities that at least one, and at least half of our observed sources are beamed towards us respectively. One of our SLSN targets, PTF10hgi, is coincident with a persistent radio source, making it a possible analogue to FRB121102. We performed further observations on this source using the Effelsberg-100~m and Parkes-64~m radio telescopes. Assuming that PTF10hgi contains an FRB121102-like source, the probabilities of not detecting any bursts from a Weibull distribution during our observations are 14\% and 16\% for Effelsberg and Parkes respectively. We conclude by showing that a survey of many short observations increases burst detection probability for a source with Weibull distributed bursting activity.",astro-ph.HE

The observations of FRB 121102 were performed simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz, and spanned a total of 27.3 hr between 2019 September 19 and 2020 February 11. We detected 2 radio bursts in the 2.3 GHz frequency band from FRB 121102, but no evidence of radio emission was found at 8.4 GHz during any of our observations. We observed FRB 180916.J0158+65 simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz, and also separately in the 1.5 GHz frequency band, for a total of 101.8 hr between 2019 September 19 and 2020 May 14. Our observations of FRB 180916.J0158+65 spanned multiple activity cycles during which the source was known to be active and covered a wide range of activity phases. Several of our observations occurred during times when bursts were detected from the source between 400-800 MHz with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope. However, no radio bursts were detected from FRB 180916.J0158+65 at any of the frequencies used during our observations with the DSN radio telescopes. We find that FRB 180916.J0158+65's apparent activity is strongly frequency-dependent due to the narrowband nature of its radio bursts, which have less spectral occupancy at high radio frequencies ($\gtrsim$ 2 GHz). We also find that fewer or fainter bursts are emitted from the source at high radio frequencies. We discuss the implications of these results on possible progenitor models of repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

By studying the environments of FRBs, evidence for magnetar formation mechanisms not observed in the Milky Way may become apparent. In this paper, we use a sample of FRB host galaxies and a complete sample of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) hosts to determine whether FRB progenitors are consistent with a population of magnetars born in CCSNe. We also compare the FRB hosts to the hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) to determine whether the population of FRB hosts is compatible with a population of transients that may be connected to millisecond magnetars. After using a novel approach to scale the stellar masses and star-formation rates of each host galaxy to be statistically representative of $z=0$ galaxies, we find that the CCSN hosts and FRBs are consistent with arising from the same distribution. Furthermore, the FRB host distribution is inconsistent with the distribution of SLSNe-I and LGRB hosts. With the current sample of FRB host galaxies, our analysis shows that FRBs are consistent with a population of magnetars born through the collapse of giant, highly magnetic stars.",astro-ph.HE

In the redshifted ($z=0.193$) source reference frame, the RM decreased from $1.46\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ to $1.33\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between January and August 2017, showing day-timescale variations of $\sim200$~rad~m$^{-2}$. Here we present sixteen FRB 121102 RMs from burst detections with the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m, and the Karl G.

Our observations show a decreasing trend in RM, although the trend is not linear, dropping by an average of 15\% year$^{-1}$ and is $\sim9.7\times10^4$~rad~m$^{-2}$ at the most recent epoch of August 2019. Erratic, short-term RM variations of $\sim10^3$~rad~m$^{-2}$ week$^{-1}$ were also observed between MJDs 58215--58247. A decades-old neutron star embedded within a still-compact supernova remnant or a neutron star near a massive black hole and its accretion torus have been proposed to explain the high RMs. We compare the observed RMs to theoretical models describing the RM evolution for FRBs originating within a supernova remnant. FRB 121102's age is unknown, and we find that the models agree for source ages of $\sim6-17$~years at the time of the first available RM measurements in 2017.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of $10^{15}$ G with a short decay lifetime of less than $10^4$ years. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star-formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of \nsecure\ secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at $>95\%$ c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.",astro-ph.HE

A new class of radio telescopes with wide fields of view have enabled a rapid accumulation of FRB observations, confirming that FRBs originate from cosmological distances. The high occurrence rate of FRBs and the development of new instruments to observe them create opportunities for FRBs to be utilized for a host of astrophysical and cosmological studies. We focus on the rare, and as yet undetected, subset of FRBs that undergo repeated bursts and are strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening structure. An extremely precise timing of burst arrival times is possible for strongly lensed repeating FRBs, and we show how this timing precision enables the search for long wavelength gravitational waves, including those sourced by supermassive black hole binary systems. The timing of burst arrival for strongly lensed repeating FRBs is sensitive to gravitational wave sources near the FRB host galaxy, which may lie at cosmological distances and would therefore be extremely challenging to detect by other means. Timing of strongly lensed FRBs can also be combined with pulsar timing array data to search for correlated time delays characteristic of gravitational waves passing through the Earth.",astro-ph.CO

Combining these galaxies with FRB hosts from the literature, we introduce criteria based on the probability of chance coincidence to define a sub-sample of 10 highly-confident associations (at $z=0.03-0.52$), three of which correspond to known repeating FRBs. Overall, the FRB host galaxies exhibit a broad, continuous range of color ($M_u-M_r = 0.9 - 2.0$), stellar mass ($M_\star = 10^{8} - 6\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$), and star-formation rate (${\rm SFR} = 0.05 - 10\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) spanning the full parameter space occupied by $z<0.5$ galaxies. However, they do not track the color-magnitude, SFR-$M_\star$, nor BPT diagrams of field galaxies surveyed at similar redshifts. There is an excess of ""green valley"" galaxies and an excess of emission-line ratios indicative of a harder radiation field than that generated by star-formation alone. From the observed stellar mass distribution, we rule out the hypothesis that FRBs strictly track stellar mass in galaxies ($>99\%$ c.l.). We measure a median offset of 3.3 kpc from the FRB to the estimated center of the host galaxies and compare the host-burst offset distribution and other properties with the distributions of long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs and SGRBs), core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe), and Type Ia SNe. This analysis rules out galaxies hosting LGRBs (faint, star-forming galaxies) as common hosts for FRBs ($>95\%$ c.l.). Other transient channels (SGRBs, CC- and Type Ia SNe) have host galaxy properties and offsets consistent with the FRB distributions.

From UTC 2020 April 27 23:55:00 to 2020 April 28 00:50:37, FAST detected no pulsed radio emission from SGR J1935+2154, while Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor registered 34 bursts in the X/soft $\gamma$-ray band, forming a unique sample of X-ray bursts in the absence of FRBs. After a comprehensive analysis on light curves, time-integrated, and time-resolved spectral properties of these FRB-absent X-ray bursts, we compare this sample with the FRB-associated X-ray burst detected by Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind. The FRB-associated burst distinguishes itself from other X-ray bursts by its nonthermal spectrum and a higher spectral peak energy, but otherwise is not atypical. We also compare the cumulative energy distribution of our X-ray burst sample with that of first repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, with the calibration of FRB 200428-X-ray burst association. We find a similarity between the two, offering indirect support of the magnetar origin of cosmological FRBs. The event rate density of magnetar bursts is about $\sim 150$ times higher than the FRB event rate density at the energy of FRB 200428.

Three hours later the rate is at 0.008 bursts s$^{-1}$, remaining at a comparatively low level thereafter. The $T_{90}$ burst duration distribution peaks at 840~ms; the distribution of waiting times to the next burst is fit with a log-normal with an average of 2.1 s. The 1-10 keV burst spectra are well fit by a blackbody, with an average temperature and area of $kT=1.7$ keV and $R^2=53$ km$^2$. The differential burst fluence distribution over $\sim3$ orders of magnitude is well modeled with a power-law form $dN/dF\propto F^{-1.5\pm0.1}$. The source persistent emission pulse profile is double-peaked hours after the burst storm. We find that the bursts peak arrival times follow a uniform distribution in pulse phase, though the fast radio burst associated with the source aligns in phase with the brighter peak. We measure the source spin-down from heavy-cadence observations covering days 21 to 39 post-outburst, $\dot\nu=-3.72(3)\times10^{-12}$ Hz s$^{-1}$; a factor 2.7 larger than the value measured after the 2014 outburst.

While the emission bandwidths of the ASKAP and UWL bursts show $\nu^{-4}$ scaling consistent with a propagation effect, the spectral occupancy is inconsistent with diffractive scintillation.

We find that for those FRBs with RM measurements, the mean $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ is $1.77^{+9.01}_{-1.48}\,\rm\mu G$ and $1.74^{+14.82}_{-1.55}\,\rm\mu G$ using two different methods, which is slightly larger but not inconsistent with the distribution of Galactic pulsars, $1.00^{+1.51}_{-0.60}\,\rm\mu G$. Only six Galactic magnetars have estimated $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$. Excluding PSR J1745--2900 that has an anomalously high value due to its proximity with the Galactic Centre, the other three sources have a mean value of $1.70\,\rm\mu G$, which is statistically consistent with the $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ distributions of both Galactic pulsars and FRBs. There is no apparent trend of evolution of magnetar $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ as a function of age or surface magnetic field strength. Galactic pulsars and magnetars close to the Galactic Centre have relatively larger $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ values than other pulsars/magnetars. We discuss the implications of these results for the magnetoionic environments of FRB 121102 within the context of magnetar model and the model invoking a supermassive black hole, and for the origin of FRBs in general.",astro-ph.HE

It has also been long predicted that coherent radio emission will occur during the merger phase or from a newly formed neutron star remnant, however this emission has not been seen to date. This paper presents the deepest limits for this emission from a neutron star merger folowing triggered LOFAR observations of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 181123B, starting 4.4 minutes after the GRB occurred. During the X-ray plateau phase, a signature of ongoing energy injection, we detect no radio emission to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 153 mJy at 144 MHz (image integration time of 136 seconds), which is significantly fainter than the predicted emission from a standard neutron star. At a redshift of 1.8, this corresponds to a luminosity of $2.5 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Snapshot images were made of the radio observation on a range of timescales, targeting short duration radio flashes similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). No emission was detected in the snapshot images at the location of GRB 181123B enabling constraints to be placed on the prompt coherent radio emission model and emission predicted to occur when a neutron star collapses to form a black hole. At the putative host redshift of 1.8 for GRB 181123B, the non detection of the prompt radio emission is two orders of magnitude lower than expected for magnetic reconnection models for prompt GRB emission and no magnetar emission is expected.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2008.12488,Shivani Bhandari et al.,Limits on precursor and afterglow radio emission from a fast radio burst in a star-forming galaxy,"We present a new fast radio burst (FRB) at 920 MHz discovered during commensal observations conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) as part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey. FRB 191001 was detected at a dispersion measure (DM) of 506.92(4) pc cm$^{-3}$ and its measured fluence of 143(15) Jy ms is the highest of the bursts localized to host galaxies by ASKAP to date. The subarcsecond localization of the FRB provided by ASKAP reveals that the burst originated in the outskirts of a highly star-forming spiral in a galaxy pair at redshift $z=0.2340(1)$. Radio observations show no evidence for a compact persistent radio source associated with the FRB 191001 above a flux density of $15 \mu$Jy. However, we detect diffuse synchrotron radio emission from the disk of the host galaxy that we ascribe to ongoing star formation. FRB 191001 was also detected as an image-plane transient in a single 10 s snapshot with a flux density of 19.3 mJy in the low-time-resolution visibilities obtained simultaneously with CRAFT data. The commensal observation facilitated a search for repeating and slowly varying radio emissions 8 hr before and 1 hr after the burst. We found no variable radio emission on timescales ranging from 1 ms to 1.4 hr. We report our upper limits and briefly review FRB progenitor theories in the literature that predict radio afterglows. Our data are still only weakly constraining of any afterglows at the redshift of the FRB. Future commensal observations of more nearby and bright FRBs will potentially provide stronger constraints.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2008.12318,"Brian D. Metzger, Ke Fang, Ben Margalit, ",Neutrino Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts,"The discovery of a luminous radio burst, FRB 200428, with properties similar to those of fast radio bursts (FRB), in coincidence with an X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological FRBs. The burst's X-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the X-ray spectral shape and peak energy, are consistent with FRB 200428 being the result of an ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously generates X-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions - heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~ TeV-PeV. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with IceCube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.",astro-ph.HE

Guidorzi et al.,Constraining the transient high-energy activity of FRB180916.J0158+65 with Insight-HXMT followup observations,"A link between magnetars and fast radio burst (FRB) sources has finally been established. In this context, one of the open issues is whether/which sources of extra galactic FRBs exhibit X/gamma-ray outbursts and whether it is correlated with radio activity. We aim to constrain possible X/gamma-ray burst activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known over a broad energy range, by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and energies that are compatible with being powerful flares from extragalactic magnetars. We followed up the as-yet nearest extragalactic FRB source at a mere 149 Mpc distance, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, during the active phase on February 4-7, 2020, with the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT). Taking advantage of the combination of broad band, large effective area, and several independent detectors available, we searched for bursts over a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm, that had previously been characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations we studied the sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase space for a set of synthetic flares and assuming different energy spectra. We constrain the possible occurrence of flares in the 1-100 keV energy band to E<10^46 erg for durations <0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure. We can rule out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in the few cases of Galactic magnetars. The absence of reported radio activity during our observations does not allow us to make any statements on the possible simultaneous high-energy emission.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2008.11738,Calvin Leung et al.,A Synoptic VLBI Technique for Localizing Non-Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB,"We demonstrate the blind interferometric detection and localization of two fast radio bursts (FRBs) with 2- and 25-arcsecond precision on the 400-m baseline between the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the CHIME Pathfinder. In the same spirit as very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), the telescopes were synchronized to separate clocks, and the channelized voltage (herein referred to as ""baseband"") data were saved to disk with correlation performed offline. The simultaneous wide field of view and high sensitivity required for blind FRB searches implies a high data rate -- 6.5 terabits per second (Tb/s) for CHIME and 0.8 Tb/s for the Pathfinder. Since such high data rates cannot be continuously saved, we buffer data from both telescopes locally in memory for $\approx 40$ s, and write to disk upon receipt of a low-latency trigger from the CHIME Fast Radio Burst Instrument (CHIME/FRB). The $\approx200$ deg$^2$ field of view of the two telescopes allows us to use in-field calibrators to synchronize the two telescopes without needing either separate calibrator observations or an atomic timing standard. In addition to our FRB observations, we analyze bright single pulses from the pulsars B0329+54 and B0355+54 to characterize systematic localization errors. Our results demonstrate the successful implementation of key software, triggering, and calibration challenges for CHIME/FRB Outriggers: cylindrical VLBI outrigger telescopes which, along with the CHIME telescope, will localize thousands of single FRB events to 50 milliarcsecond precision.",astro-ph.IM

This study has its root in the hypothesized FRB-SLSN connection that states that magnetars born in SLSN can power FRBs. The wideband spectrum (0.6--15 GHz) of PTF10hgi presented here, provides strong evidence for the magnetar wind nebular origin of the radio emission. The same spectrum also enables us to make robust estimates of the radius and the magnetic field of the radio emitting region and demonstrates that the nebula is powered by the rotational energy of the magnetar. This spectrum is then compared with that of FRB121102 which we extend down to 400 MHz using archival data. The newly added measurements put very tight constraint on the emission models of the compact persistent source associated with FRB121102. We find that while both sources can be powered by the rotational energy of the underlying magnetar, the average energy injection rate is much higher in FRB121102. Hence, we hypothesise that, if PTF10hgi is indeed emitting fast radio bursts, those will be much weaker energetically than those from FRB121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2008.10536,Stefan Hackstein et al.,Redshift estimates for fast radio bursts and implications on intergalactic magnetic fields,"Context: Fast Radio Bursts are transient radio pulses from presumably compact stellar sources of extragalactic origin. With new telescopes detecting multiple events per day, statistical methods are required in order to interpret observations and make inferences regarding astrophysical and cosmological questions. Purpose: We present a method that uses probability estimates of fast radio burst observables to obtain likelihood estimates for the underlying models. Method: Considering models for all regions along the line-of-sight, including intervening galaxies, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the distribution of the dispersion measure, rotation measure and temporal broadening. Using Bayesian statistics, we compare these predictions to observations of Fast Radio Bursts. Results: By applying Bayes theorem, we obtain lower limits on the redshift of Fast Radio Bursts with extragalactic DM $\gtrsim 400$ pc cm$^{-3}$. We find that intervening galaxies cannot account for all highly scattered Fast Radio Bursts in FRBcat, thus requiring a denser and more turbulent environment than a SGR 1935+2154-like magnetar. We show that a sample of $\gtrsim 10^3$ unlocalized Fast Radio Bursts with associated extragalactic RM $\geq 1$ rad m$^{-2}$ can improve current upper limits on the strength of intergalactic magnetic fields.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2008.09621,Tetsuya Hashimoto et al.,No redshift evolution of non-repeating fast radio-burst rates,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond transients of unknown origin(s) occurring at cosmological distances. Here we, for the first time, show time-integrated-luminosity functions and volumetric occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs against redshift. The time-integrated-luminosity functions of non-repeating FRBs do not show any significant redshift evolution. The volumetric occurrence rates are almost constant during the past $\sim$10 Gyr. The nearly-constant rate is consistent with a flat trend of cosmic stellar-mass density traced by old stellar populations. Our findings indicate that the occurrence rate of non-repeating FRBs follows the stellar-mass evolution of long-living objects with $\sim$Gyr time scales, favouring e.g. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as likely progenitors of non-repeating FRBs. In contrast, the occurrence rates of repeating FRBs may increase towards higher redshifts in a similar way to the cosmic star formation-rate density or black hole accretion-rate density if the slope of their luminosity function does not evolve with redshift. Short-living objects with $\lesssim$ Myr time scales associated with young stellar populations (or their remnants, e.g., supernova remnants, young pulsars, and magnetars) or active galactic nuclei might be favoured as progenitor candidates of repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Ding et al.,A magnetar parallax,"XTE J1810-197 (J1810) was the first magnetar identified to emit radio pulses, and has been extensively studied during a radio-bright phase in 2003$-$2008. It is estimated to be relatively nearby compared to other Galactic magnetars, and provides a useful prototype for the physics of high magnetic fields, magnetar velocities, and the plausible connection to extragalactic fast radio bursts. Upon the re-brightening of the magnetar at radio wavelengths in late 2018, we resumed an astrometric campaign on J1810 with the Very Long Baseline Array, and sampled 14 new positions of J1810 over 1.3 years. The phase calibration for the new observations was performed with two phase calibrators that are quasi-colinear on the sky with J1810, enabling substantial improvement of the resultant astrometric precision. Combining our new observations with two archival observations from 2006, we have refined the proper motion and reference position of the magnetar and have measured its annual geometric parallax, the first such measurement for a magnetar. The parallax of $0.40\pm0.05\,$mas corresponds to a most probable distance $2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\,$kpc for J1810. Our new astrometric results confirm an unremarkable transverse peculiar velocity of $\approx200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for J1810, which is only at the average level among the pulsar population.

The radio bursts show that the ordinary frequency drift from high to low frequencies slows down and stops, and a frequency drift from low to high frequencies appears. An analysis of all data on the corresponding flares provides evidence of formation of quasi standing fast mode shocks (termination shocks, TS). TS are able to generate energetic electrons, responsible for the appearance of new sources of hard X ray radiation and generation of fast radio bursts (spikes), fibers and zebra structures. The sources of the radio emission bands with the unusual frequency drift are situated above the top of the post flare loops (lower TS) or are connected with the erupting prominence or coronal mass ejection (CME, upper TS). Estimations of the critical Mach numbers for the ordinary plasma parameters in the solar flares give the values 1.3 easily realized in the flare events.

Wu et al.,Understanding FRB 200428 in the synchrotron maser shock model: consistency and possible challenge,"Recently, the discovery of Galactic FRB 200428 associated with a X-ray burst (XRB) of SGR 1935+2154 has built a bridge between FRBs and magnetar activities. In this paper, we assume that the XRB occurs in the magnetar magnetosphere. We show that the observational properties of FRB 200428 and the associated XRB are consistent with the predictions of synchrotron maser emission at ultrarelativistic magnetized shocks, including radiation efficiency, similar energy occurrence frequency distributions, and simultaneous arrive times. It requires that the upstream medium is a mildly relativistic baryonic shell ejected by a previous flare. The energy injection by flares responsible for the radio bursts will produce a magnetar wind nebula, which has been used to explain the persistent radio source associated FRB 121102. We find that the radio continuum around SGR 1935+2154 can be well understood in the magnetar wind nebula model, by assuming the same energy injection rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-1.37}$ as FRB 121102. The required baryonic mass is also estimated form the observations of FRB 121102 by GBT and FAST. By assuming the same radiation efficiency $\eta \sim 10^{-5}$, the total baryonic mass ejected from the central magnetar is about 0.005 solar mass. This value is much larger than the typical mass of a magnetar outer crust, but is comparable to the total mass of a magnetar crust.",astro-ph.HE

These modes are superimposed to form a spiral arm configuration and its edge is found to be a likely site for magnetic reconnection. These modes also enhance the total Poynting flux from neutron star binaries by a factor of 2--4.

The effect is not strong and cosmological tests using FRBs will be possible, but to preserve the level of statistical uncertainty the number of FRBs with known redshift in a sample should be increased by 15%--35% depending on circumstances.

FRB 20200125A was detected at a Galactic latitude of 58.43 degrees with a dispersion measure of 179 pc cm$^{-3}$, while electron density models predict a maximum Galactic contribution of 25 pc cm$^{-3}$ along this line of sight. Moreover, no apparent Galactic foreground sources of ionized gas that could account for the excess DM are visible in multi-wavelength surveys of this region. This argues that the source is extragalactic. The maximum redshift for the host galaxy is $z_{max}=0.17$, corresponding to a maximum comoving distance of approximately 750 Mpc. The measured peak flux density for FRB 20200125A is 0.37 Jy, and we measure a pulse width of 3.7 ms, consistent with the distribution of FRB widths observed at higher frequencies. Based on this detection and assuming an Euclidean flux density distribution of FRBs, we calculate an all-sky rate at 350 MHz of $3.4^{+15.4}_{-3.3} \times 10^3$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.42 Jy for an unscattered pulse having an intrinsic width of 5 ms, consistent with rates reported at higher frequencies. Given the recent improvements in our single-pulse search pipeline, we also revisit the GBNCC survey sensitivity to various burst properties. Finally, we find no evidence of interstellar scattering in FRB 20200125A, adding to the growing evidence that some FRBs have circumburst environments where free-free absorption and scattering are not significant.",astro-ph.HE

We investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by the magnetic energy injection inside the magnetosphere, thereby producing magnetically-trapped fireball (FB) and relativistic outflows simultaneously. The thermal component of the X-ray burst is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature of $\sim200$-$300$ keV and size of $\sim10^5$ cm. Meanwhile, the non-thermal component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow, launched with an energy budget of $10^{39}$-$10^{40}$ erg comparable to that for the trapped FB, for different initial baryon load $\eta$ and magnetization $\sigma_0$. If hard X-ray and radio bursts are both produced by the energy dissipation of the outflow, the outflow properties are constrained by combining the conditions for photon escape and the intrinsic timing offset $\lesssim10$ ms among radio and X-ray burst spikes. We show that the hard X-ray burst must be generated at $r_{\rm X}\gtrsim10^{8}$ cm from the magnetar, irrespective of the emission mechanism. Moreover, we find that the outflow quickly accelerates up to a Lorentz factor of $10^2\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim10^3$ by the time it reaches the edge of the magnetosphere and the dissipation occurs at $10^{12}$ cm $\lesssim r_{\rm radio,X}\lesssim10^{14}$ cm.

Cruces et al.,"Repeating behaviour of FRB 121102: periodicity, waiting times and energy distribution","Detections from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 are clustered in time, noticeable even in the earliest repeat bursts. Recently, it was argued that the source activity is periodic, suggesting that the clustering reflected a not-yet-identified periodicity. We performed an extensive multi-wavelength campaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope and the Arecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR (X-ray) and INTEGRAL (gamma-ray). We detected 36 bursts with Effelsberg, one with a pulse width of 39\,ms, the widest burst ever detected from FRB 121102. With one burst detected during simultaneous NuSTAR observations, we place a 5-$\sigma$ upper limit of $5\times10^{47}$ erg on the 3--79\,keV energy of an X-ray burst counterpart. We tested the periodicity hypothesis using 165-hr of Effelsberg observations and find a periodicity of 161$\pm$5 days. We predict the source to be active from 2020-07-09 to 2020-10-14 and subsequently from 2020-12-17 to 2021-03-24. We compare the wait times between consecutive bursts within a single observation to Weibull and Poisson distributions. We conclude that the strong clustering was indeed a consequence of a periodic activity and show that if the few events with millisecond separation are excluded, the arrival times are Poisson distributed. We model the bursts' cumulative energy distribution with energies from ${\sim}10^{38}$-$10^{39}$ erg and find that it is well described by a power-law with slope of $\gamma=-1.1\pm 0.2$.

Of special interest are the ultramassive white dwarfs, as they are related to type Ia Supernovae explosions, merger events, and Fast Radio Bursts. Ultramassive white dwarfs are expected to harbour oxygen-neon (ONe) cores as a result of single standard stellar evolution. However, a fraction of them could have carbon-oxygen (CO) cores. Recent studies, based on the new observations provided by the {\it Gaia} space mission, indicate that a small fraction of the ultramassive white dwarfs experience a strong delay in their cooling, which cannot be attributed only to the occurrence of crystallization, thus requiring an unknown energy source able to prolong their life for long periods of time. In this study we find that the energy released by $^{22}$Ne sedimentation in the deep interior of ultramassive white dwarfs with CO cores and high $^{22}$Ne content is consistent with the long cooling delay of these stellar remnants. On the basis of a synthesis study of the white dwarf population, based on Monte Carlo techniques, we find that the observations revealed by {\it Gaia} can be explained by the existence of these prolonged youth ultramassive white dwarfs. Although such a high $^{22}$Ne abundance is not consistent with the standard evolutionary channels, our results provide sustain to the existence of CO-core ultramassive white dwarfs and to the occurrence of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation.",astro-ph.SR

arXiv:2008.02395,Fereshteh Rajabi et al.,A simple relationship for the spectro-temporal structure of bursts from FRB 121102,"We consider a simple dynamical and relativistic model to explain the spectro-temporal structure often displayed by repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show how this model can account for the downward frequency drift in a sequence of sub-bursts of increasing arrival time (the ""sad trombone"" effect) and their tendency for exhibiting a reduced pulse width with increasing frequency of observation. Most importantly, this model also predicts a systematic inverse relationship between the (steeper) slope of the frequency drift observed within a single sub-burst and its temporal duration. Using already published data for FRB 121102 we find and verify the relationship predicted by this model. We therefore argue that the overall behaviour observed for this object as a function of frequency is consistent with an underlying narrow-band emission process, where the wide-band nature of the measured FRB spectrum is due to relativistic motions. Although this scenario and the simple dynamics we consider could be applied to other theories, they are well-suited for a model based upon Dicke's superradiance as the physical process responsible for FRB radiation in this and similar sources.",astro-ph.HE

We argue that the X-ray bursts with high temperature $T \gtrsim 30$ keV entail an electron--positron ($e^{\pm}$) outflow from a trapped--expanding fireball, polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The $e^{\pm}$ outflow is opaque to FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts. Nevertheless, the FRB photons can break out of the $e^{\pm}$ outflow with radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS radii. A FRB is choked if the FRB is weaker or the X-ray bursts are stronger, possibly explaining why there are no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the $e^{\pm}$ outflow may be inevitable for FRBs, solving the problem of why the FRBs occur only with high-$T$ X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the emission mechanism and electromagnetic counterparts to future FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Revealing their origin is one of the central foci in modern astronomy. Previous studies suggest that occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs could be controlled by the cosmic stellar-mass density (CSMD) and star formation-rate density (CSFRD), respectively. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is one of the best future instruments to address this subject due to its high sensitivity and high-angular resolution. Here, we predict the number of FRBs to be detected with the SKA. In contrast to previous predictions, we estimate the detections of non-repeating and repeating FRBs separately, based on latest observational constraints on their physical properties including the spectral indices, FRB luminosity functions, and their redshift evolutions. We consider two cases of redshift evolution of FRB luminosity functions following either the CSMD or CSFRD. At $z\gtrsim2$, $z\gtrsim6$ and $z\gtrsim10$, non-repeating FRBs will be detected with the SKA at a rate of $\sim10^{4}$, $\sim10^{2}$, and $\sim10$ (sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$), respectively, if their luminosity function follows the CSMD evolution. At $z\gtrsim1$, $z\gtrsim2$, and $z\gtrsim4$, sources of repeating FRBs will be detected at a rate of $\sim10^{3}$, $\sim10^{2}$, and $\lesssim10$ (sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$), respectively, assuming that the redshift evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD. These numbers could change by about one order of magnitude depending on the assumptions on the CSMD and CSFRD. In all cases, abundant FRBs will be detected by the SKA, which will further constrain the luminosity functions and number density evolutions.",astro-ph.HE

Based on a few host galaxy observations, a large sample of galaxy with similar properties to observed ones has been selected from the IllustrisTNG simulation. They are used to compute the distributions of host galaxy DMs for repeating and non-repeating FRBs. For repeating FRBs, we infer the DM$ _{\mathrm{host}} $ for FRBs like FRB 121102 and FRB 180916 by assuming that the burst sites are tracing the star formation rates in host galaxies.

In another case, the median of DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ is about $30 - 70$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for non-repeating FRBs in the redshift range $z=0.1-1.5$, assuming that the burst sites are the locations of binary neutron star mergers. In this case, the evolution of the median DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ can be calculated by $33(1+z)^{0.84}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The distributions of DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ of repeating and non-repeating FRBs can be well fitted with the log-normal function.

The AO observations had sufficient sensitivity to detect any FRB of similar luminosity to the one recently detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Assuming a Schechter function for the luminosity function of FRBs, we find that our non-detections favor a steep power--law index ($\alpha\lesssim-1.0$) and a large cut--off luminosity ($L_0 \gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg/s).",astro-ph.HE

It is independent of any model of the Galaxy, i.e., we do not assume the density of the disk or the halo, spatial extent of the halo, baryonic mass content, or any such external constraints to measure $DM_{Gal}$. We use 21-cm, UV, EUV and X-ray data to account for different phases, and find that $DM_{Gal}$ is dominated by the hot phase probed by X-ray absorption. We improve upon the measurements of N(\oviin) and f$_{OVII}$ compared to previous studies, thus providing a better estimate of the hot phase contribution. The median $DM_{Gal}$=64$^{+20}_{-23}$ cm$^{-3}$ pc, with a 68\% (90\%) confidence interval of 33--172 (23--660) cm$^{-3}$ pc. The $DM_{Gal}$ does not appear to follow any trend with the galactic longitude or latitude, and there is a large scatter around the values predicted by simple disk+spherical halo models. Our measurements provide more complete and accurate estimates of $DM_{Gal}$ independent from the previous studies. We provide a table and a code to retrieve $DM_{Gal}$ for any FRB localized in the sky.",astro-ph.GA

arXiv:2007.07265,"Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar, ",What does FRB light-curve variability tell us about the emission mechanism?,"A few fast radio bursts' (FRBs) light-curves have exhibited large intrinsic modulations of their flux on extremely short ($t_{\rm r}\sim 10\mu$s) time scales, compared to pulse durations ($t_{\rm FRB}\sim1$ms). Light-curve variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far ($\gtrsim 10^{10}$cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical set-ups that can account for the observed $t_{\rm r}/t_{\rm FRB}\ll 1$ despite having large emission radii. The result is either a significant reduction in the radio production efficiency or distinct light-curves features that could be searched for in observed data. For the same class of models, we also show that due to high-latitude emission, if a flux $f_1(\nu_1)$ is observed at $t_1$ then at a lower frequency $\nu_2<\nu_1$ the flux should be at least $(\nu_2/\nu_1)^2f_1$ at a slightly later time ($t_2=t_1\nu_1/\nu_2$) independent of the duration and spectrum of the emission in the comoving frame. These features can be tested, once light-curve modulations due to scintillation are accounted for. We provide the timescales and coherence bandwidths of the latter for a range of possibilities regarding the physical screens and the scintillation regime. Finally, if future highly resolved FRB light-curves are shown to have intrinsic variability extending down to $\sim \mu$s timescales, this will provide strong evidence in favor of magnetospheric models.",astro-ph.HE

The recent CHIME/FRB and STARE2 detection of an extremely bright (fluence $\sim$MJy$\,$ms) radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935$+$2154 supports the hypothesis that (at least some) FRBs are emitted by magnetars at cosmological distances. In follow-up observations totalling 522.7$\,$hrs on source, we detect two bright radio bursts with fluences of $112\pm22\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$ and $24\pm5\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$, respectively. Both bursts appear affected by interstellar scattering and we measure significant linear and circular polarisation for the fainter burst. The bursts are separated in time by $\sim$1.4$\,$s, suggesting a non-Poissonian, clustered emission process -- similar to what has been seen in some repeating FRBs. Together with the burst reported by CHIME/FRB and STARE2, as well as a much fainter burst seen by FAST (fluence 60$\mathrm{\,mJy\,ms}$), our observations demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 can produce bursts with apparent energies spanning roughly seven orders of magnitude, and that the burst rate is comparable across this range. This raises the question of whether these four bursts arise from similar physical processes, and whether the FRB population distribution extends to very low energies ($\sim10^{30}\,$erg, isotropic equivalent).",astro-ph.HE

Via the statistical analysis of turbulence along different sightlines toward a population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we demonstrate that FRBs provide a unique tool to probe the intergalactic turbulence. We measure the structure function (SF) of dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs to study the multi-scale electron density fluctuations induced by the intergalactic turbulence. The SF has a large amplitude and a Kolmogorov power-law scaling with angular separations, showing large and correlated DM fluctuations over a range of length scales.

The dispersion measure (DM) of the radio signal is a probe of the integrated electron density along the line of sight and therefore allows to map the electron distribution within the large-scale structure. Since a fraction of electrons gets expelled from galaxies by feedback, they are anticorrelated with halos at large scales and hence the angular DM correlations show a scale-dependent bias caused by primordial non-Gaussianity. Although the signal is weaker than in other probes like galaxy clustering, FRBs can potentially probe considerably larger volumes. We show that while studying the FRB clustering signal requires very large samples, correlations in the DM are cosmic-variance limited on large angular scales with only $\sim 10^{3-4}$ events. A tomographic analysis of the angular DM correlation function can constrain the local primordial bispectrum shape parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$ to a precision down to ${f_\mathrm{NL}}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ depending on assumptions about the FRB redshift distribution and the astrophysical feedback on large scales.

Lewis, ",Gravitational Microlensing Time Delays at High Optical Depth: Image Parities and the Temporal Properties of Fast Radio Bursts,"Due to differing gravitational potentials and path lengths, gravitational lensing induces time delays between multiple images of a source which, for solar mass objects, is of order $\sim10^{-5}$ seconds. If an astrophysically compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational lensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In this paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the time arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and then progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of the time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by brighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The growing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs, which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal resolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of microlensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational lens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.",astro-ph.CO

The detection of a coincident bright X-ray burst has revealed the first observed multi-wavelength counterpart of a FRB. However, the search for similar emission at optical wavelengths has been hampered by the high inferred extinction on the line of sight. Here, we present results from the first search for second-timescale emission from the source at near-infrared wavelengths using the Palomar Gattini-IR observing system in J-band, made possible by a recently implemented detector read-out mode that allowed for short exposure times of 0.84 s with 99.9% observing efficiency. With a total observing time of 12 hours (47728 images) on source, we place median $3\,\sigma$ limits on the second-timescale emission of $< 20$ mJy (13.1 AB mag). We present non-detection limits from epochs of four simultaneous X-ray bursts detected by the Insight-{\it HXMT} and {\it NuSTAR} telescopes during our observing campaign. The limits translate to an extinction corrected fluence limit of $< 125$ Jy ms for an estimated extinction of $A_J = 2.0$ mag. These limits provide the most stringent constraints to date on the fluence of flares at frequencies of $\sim 10^{14}$ Hz, and constrain the ratio of the near-infrared (NIR) fluence to that of coincident X-ray bursts to $R_{\rm NIR} < 2.5 \times 10^{-2}$. Our observations were sensitive enough to easily detect a near-infrared counterpart of FRB 200428 if the NIR emission falls on the same power law as that observed across its radio to X-ray spectrum. The non-detection of NIR emission around the coincident X-ray bursts constrains the fluence index of the brightest burst to be steeper than $0.35$.",astro-ph.HE

By using gravitational wave sources of unknown redshift that are detectable from the network of gravitational wave detectors with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, we will be able to obtain accurate and precise measurements of the local Hubble constant, the expansion history of the universe, and the gravitational wave bias parameter, which captures the distribution of gravitational wave sources with respect to the redshift tracer distribution. While we showcase its application to low redshift gravitational waves, this technique will be applicable also to the high redshift gravitational wave sources detectable from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Cosmic Explorer (CE), and Einstein Telescope (ET).

arXiv:2007.02886,"S. R. Kulkarni, ","Dispersion measure: Confusion, Constants & Clarity","The dispersion measure (DM) is one of the key attributes of radio pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). There is a mistaken view that the DM is an accurate measure of the column density of electrons between the observer and the source. To start with, the DM, unlike a true column density, is not a Lorentz invariant. Next, the DM also includes contribution from ions and is sensitive to the temperature of the plasma in the intervening clouds. Separately, the primary observable is the dispersion slope, $\mathcal{D}\equiv \Delta{(t)}/\Delta{(\nu^{-2}})$, where $t(\nu)$ is the arrival time at frequency, $\nu$. A scaling factor composed of physical and astronomical constants is needed to convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM. In the early days of pulsar astronomy the relevant constants were defined to parts per million (ppm). As a result, a convention arose in which this conversion factor was fixed. Over time, several such conventions came about -- recipe for confusion. Meanwhile, over the past several years, the SI system has been restructured and the parsec is now exactly defined. As a result, the present accuracy of the conversion factor is below a part per billion -- many orders of magnitude better than the best measurement errors of $\mathcal{D}$. We are now in an awkward situation wherein the primary ""observable"", the DM, has incorrect scaling factor(s). To address these two concerns I propose that astronomers report the primary measurement, $\mathcal{D}$ (with a suggested normalization of $10^{15}\,$Hz), and not the DM. Interested users can convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM without the need to know secret handshakes of the pulsar timing communities.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2007.02400,"Shunke Ai, He Gao, Bing Zhang, ",On the true fractions of repeating and non-repeating FRB sources,"Observationally, fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating (one-off) ones. It is unclear whether all FRBs repeat and whether there are genuine non-repeating FRBs. We attempt to address these questions using Monte Carlo simulations. We define a parameter $T_c$ at which the accumulated number of non-repeating sources becomes comparable to the total number of the repeating sources, which is a good proxy to denote the intrinsic repeater fraction among FRBs. Assuming that both types of sources exist and that their burst energies follow power law distributions, we investigate how the {\em observed} repeater fraction evolves with time for different parameters. If the lifetime of repeaters is sufficiently long so that the evolutionary effect can be neglected within the observational time span, unless $T_c \rightarrow \infty$ (i.e. there is no genuine non-repeating FRB source) the observed repeater fraction should increase with time first, reach a peak, and then decline. The peak time $T_p$ and the peak fraction $F_{\rm r,obs,p}$ depend on $T_c$ and other repeating rate parameters. With the current data, we pose a lower limit $T_c > 0.1$ d for reasonable parameter values. We predict that future continuous monitoring of FRBs with CHIME or similar wide-field radio telescopes would obtain an $F_{\rm r,obs}$ less than $0.04$. The detection of a smaller peak value $F_{\rm r,obs,p}<0.04$ in the near future would disfavor the ansatz that ""all FRB sources repeat"".",astro-ph.HE

The two putative host galaxies have similar photometric redshifts of $z_{\rm{phot}}\sim0.6$, but different colors and stellar masses.

However, the absence of simultaneously detected high-energy emission in the Swift and AGILE observations imposes stringent constraints on the field magnitude and questions the possibility of such a progenitor. We show that consideration of forced precession of a neutron star does not encounter the difficulty. This kind of precession takes place even if the neutron star is not deformed and is brought about by the anomalous moment of electromagnetic forces induced by stellar rotation and determined by non-corotational currents. Contrary to what is expected for the currents of corotation, the anomalous torque calculated by the direct method appears to be non-zero. If the observed 16.35-day period corresponds to the period of stellar precession, the inferred internal magnetic field appears to be about $6\times10^{14}$ G for rotational period 1 s. For another possibly periodic FRB 121102 with 157-day period the magnetic field is even lower, $2\times10^{14}$ G, thereby justifying earlier considerations and not ruling out the hypothesis of FRB origin from precessing neutron stars.",astro-ph.HE

In our modest sample we see no evidence for bimodality in the pulse width distribution. We also identify five FRBs with evidence of millisecond timescale pulse broadening caused by scattering in inhomogeneous plasma. We find no evidence for a relationship between pulse broadening and extragalactic dispersion measure.

Similar frequencies are also present in high signal-to-noise magnetar short bursts. In magnetars, disturbances of the field are strongly coupled to the NS crust regardless of the triggering mechanism of short bursts. For low-altitude magnetospheric magnetar models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) associated with magnetar short bursts, such as the low-twist model, crustal oscillations may be associated with additional radio bursts in the encompassing short burst event (as recently suggested for SGR 1935+2154). Given the large extragalactic volume probed by wide-field radio transient facilities, this offers the prospect of studying NS crusts leveraging samples far more numerous than galactic high-energy magnetar bursts by studying statistics of sub-burst structure or clustered trains of FRBs. We explore the prospects for distinguishing NS equation of state models with increasingly larger future sets of FRB observations. Lower $l$-number eigenmodes (corresponding to FRB time intervals of $\sim5-50$ ms) are likely less susceptible than high-$l$ modes to confusion by systematic effects associated with the NS crust physics, magnetic field, and damping. They may be more promising in their utility, and also may corroborate models where FRBs arise from mature magnetars. Future observational characterization of such signals can also determine whether they can be employed as cosmological ""standard oscillators"" to constrain redshift, or can be used to constrain the mass of FRB-producing magnetars when reliable redshifts are available.",astro-ph.HE

We find this radio burst challenges the typical emission mechanisms involving magnetars, which includes coherent curvature radiation from charged bunches, fast magnetosonic (FMS) wave, synchrotron maser from shocks, and the pulsar-like mechanism for low-twist magnetars. More specifically, we find that (1) the X-rays are most-likely to be produced inside the magnetosphere. (2) For the coherent curvature radiation from the decay of Alfv\'en wave, it will generally predict a duration ($\lesssim0.1$ ms) smaller than observations, because of the strong twists of magnetic field lines and the internal damping of Alfv\'en waves. (3) The FMS wave model predicts a very low emission frequency $\nu_{\rm p}\sim0.03$ MHz $\ll$ GHz, unless it is produced inside the magnetosphere. But the absorption effect of the magnetospheric FMS wave model remains to be studied. (4) The synchrotron maser model is challenged, because observations show that the peaks in both X-ray and radio light curves are with the same temporal separation $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}=\Delta t_\gamma\approx0.03$ s, while it would predict $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}\ll\Delta t_\gamma$. (5) It seems to be difficult to directly apply the low-twist pulsar-like mechanism to flaring magnetars, as magnetar activity can significantly deform the magnetosphere.

Modeling a weak scattering screen in the supernova remnant associated with the magnetar, we find that a superluminal apparent transverse velocity of the emission region of $>9.5\,c$ is needed to explain the spectral variation. Alternatively, the two components could have originated from independent emission regions spaced by $>8.3\times10^4\,$km. These scenarios may arise in ""far-away"" models where the emission originates from well beyond the magnetosphere of the magnetar (for example through a synchrotron-maser mechanism set up by an ultra-relativistic radiative shock), but not in ""close-in"" models of emission from within the magnetosphere.

These broadband spectra permit direct comparison with the spectrum of the FRB-associated X-ray burst (FRB-X). We demonstrate that all 24 NICER/GBM bursts are very similar temporally, albeit strikingly different spectrally, from FRB-X.

We build a model of FRB Dispersion Measure following the HeII reionization model, density fluctuation in large scale structure, host galaxy interstellar medium and local environment of FRB contribution. The model is fit to the ideal intergalactic medium (IGM) dispersion measure model to check the goodness of constraining the HeII reionization via FRB measurement statistics.   Conclusion. We report our findings under two categories, accuracy in detection of HeII reionization via FRBs assuming no uncertainty in the redshift measurement and alternatively assuming a varied level of uncertainty in redshift measurement of the FRBs. We show that under the first case, a detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O} (10^2)$ FRBs give an uncertainty of $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.5$ from the fit model, and a detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O} (10^3)$ gives an uncertainty of $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.1$. While assuming a redshift uncertainty of level $5-20\%$, changes the $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.5$ to $0.6$ for $N\sim 100$ and $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.1$ to $0.15$ for $N \sim 1000$ case.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2006.09680,"Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu, ",Combined Limit on the Photon Mass with Nine Localized Fast Radio Bursts,"A nonzero-mass hypothesis for the photon can produces a frequency-dependent dispersion of light, which results in arrival-time differences of photons with different frequencies originating from a given transient source. Extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their low frequency emissions, short time durations, and long propagation distances, are excellent astrophysical probes to constrain the rest mass of the photon $m_{\gamma}$. However, the derivation of a limit on $m_{\gamma}$ is complicated by the similar frequency dependences of dispersion expected from the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects. If a handful measurements of redshift for FRBs are available, the different redshift dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) might be able to break dispersion degeneracy in testing the photon mass. For now, nine FRBs with redshift measurements have been reported, which can turn this idea into reality. Taking into account the DM contributions from both the plasma and a possible photon mass, we use the data on the nine FRBs to derive a combined limit of $m_{\gamma}\leq7.1\times10^{-51}\;{\rm kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma}\leq4.0\times10^{-15}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ at 68\% confidence level, which is essentially as good as or represents a factor of 7 improvement over previous limits obtained by the single FRBs. Additionally, a reasonable estimation for the DM contribution from the host galaxy, $\rm DM_{host}$, can be simultaneously achieved in our analysis. The rapid progress in localizing FRBs will further tighten the constraints on both $m_{\gamma}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$.",astro-ph.HE

Kong et al.,A Variable X-ray Source Close to the Magnetar SGR 1935+2154,"The recent discovery of a millisecond radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has initiated an intense discussion about the connection between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although some properties of the radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 are not the same as cosmological FRBs, there are theoretical models which propose a connection between magnetars and FRBs (see review by Margalit et al. 2020). In particular, the role of a magnetar wind nebula is included in some models, and therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the X-ray environment of SGR 1935+2154 in more detail. Here, we report on the discovery of an X-ray transient feature near SGR 1935+2154 using archival Chandra data and discuss its possible origin.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2006.04649,Yajie Yuan et al.,Plasmoid ejection by AlfvÃ©n waves and the fast radio bursts from SGR 1935+2154,"Using numerical simulations we show that low-amplitude Alfv\'en waves from a magnetar quake propagate to the outer magnetosphere and convert to ""plasmoids"" (closed magnetic loops) which accelerate from the star, driving blast waves into the magnetar wind. Quickly after its formation, the plasmoid becomes a thin relativistic pancake. It pushes out the magnetospheric field lines, and they gradually reconnect behind the pancake, generating a variable wind far stronger than the normal spindown wind of the magnetar. Repeating ejections drive blast waves in the amplified wind. We suggest that these ejections generate the simultaneous X-ray and radio bursts detected from SGR 1935+2154. A modest energy budget of the magnetospheric perturbation $\sim 10^{40}$ erg is sufficient to produce the observed bursts. Our simulation predicts a narrow (a few ms) X-ray spike from the magnetosphere, arriving almost simultaneously with the radio burst emitted far outside the magnetosphere. This timing is caused by the extreme relativistic motion of the ejecta.",astro-ph.HE

Scenarios involving magnetars for FRBs are hence highly favored. In this work, we suggest that the impact between an asteroid and a magnetar could explain such a detection. According to our calculations, an asteroid of mass $10^{20}$ g will be disrupted at a distance of $7 \times 10^9$ cm when approaching the magnetar. The accreted material will flow along the magnetic field lines from the Alfv\'en radius $\sim 10^7$ cm. After falling onto the magnetar's surface, an instant accretion column will be formed, producing a Comptonized X-ray burst and an FRB in the magnetosphere. We show that all the observational features of FRB 200428 could be interpreted self-consistently in this scenario. We predict quasi-periodic oscillations in this specific X-ray burst, which can serve as an independent observational test.",astro-ph.HE

The radio burst was detected by VLA/realfast and followed-up by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in very low latency utilizing new operational capabilities of Swift (arXiv:2005.01751), with pointed soft X-ray and UV observations beginning at T0+32 minutes, and hard X-ray/gamma-ray event data saved around T0. These observations are $>10$x faster than previous X-ray/UV follow-up of any radio transient to date. No emission is seen coincident with the FRB candidate at T0, with a 0.2s fluence $5\sigma$ upper limit of $1.35\times10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (14-195 keV) for a SGR 1935+2154-like flare, nor at T0+32 minutes down to $3\sigma$ upper limits of 22.18 AB mag in UVOT u band, and $3.33\times10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ from 0.3-10 keV for the 2 ks observation. The candidate FRB alone is not significant enough to be considered astrophysical, so this note serves as a technical demonstration. These new Swift operational capabilities will allow future FRB detections to be followed up with Swift at even lower latencies than demonstrated here: 15-20 minutes should be regularly achievable, and 5-10 minutes occasionally achievable. We encourage FRB detecting facilities to release alerts in low latency to enable this science.",astro-ph.HE

The electron-positron pair bunches will be generated via two-stream instability in the magnetosphere, and these pairs will undergo charge separation in the $E_\parallel$ and in the meantime emit coherent curvature radiation. Following the approach of Yang & Zhang (2018), we find that the superposed curvature radiation becomes narrower due to charge separation, with the width of spectrum depending on the separation between the electron and positron clumps. This mechanism can interpret the narrow spectra of FRBs, in particular, the spectrum of Galactic FRB 200428 recently detected in association with a hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2006.03081,"Aliya-Nur Babul, Lorenzo Sironi, ",The synchrotron maser emission from relativistic magnetized shocks: Dependence on the pre-shock temperature,"Electromagnetic precursor waves generated by the synchrotron maser instability at relativistic magnetized shocks have been recently invoked to explain the coherent radio emission of Fast Radio Bursts. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we explore the properties of the precursor waves in relativistic electron-positron perpendicular shocks as a function of the pre-shock magnetization $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., the ratio of incoming Poynting flux to particle energy flux) and thermal spread $\Delta \gamma \equiv kT/mc^2=10^{-5}-10^{-1}$. We measure the fraction $f_\xi$ of total incoming energy that is converted into precursor waves, as computed in the post-shock frame. At fixed magnetization, we find that $f_{\xi}$ is nearly independent of temperature as long as $\Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$ (with only a modest decrease of a factor of three from $\Delta\gamma =10^{-5}$ to $\Delta\gamma =10^{-1.5}$), but it drops by nearly two orders of magnitude for $\Delta \gamma \gtrsim 10^{-1}$. At fixed temperature, the scaling with magnetization $f_\xi\sim 10^{-3}\,\sigma^{-1}$ is consistent with our earlier one-dimensional results. For our reference $\sigma=1$, the power spectrum of precursor waves is relatively broad (fractional width $\sim 1-3$) for cold temperatures, whereas it shows pronounced line-like features with fractional width $\sim 0.2$ for $10^{-3} \lesssim \Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5} $. For $\sigma\gtrsim 1$, the precursor waves are beamed within an angle $\simeq \sigma^{-1/2}$ from the shock normal (as measured in the post-shock frame), as required so they can outrun the shock. Our results can provide physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission models based on maser emission from relativistic shocks.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:2006.01552,"Wen-Cong Chen, ",Periodically-repeating fast radio bursts: Lense-Thirring precession of a debris disk?,"Recently, repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) with a period of $P_{\rm FRB}=16.35\pm0.18$ days from FRB 180916.J0158+65 had been reported. It still remains controversial how to give rise to such a periodicity of this FRB. In this Letter, based on an assumption of a young pulsar surrounding by a debris disk, we attempt to diagnose whether the Lense-Thirring precession of the disk on the emitter can produce the observed periodicity. Our calculations indicate that the Lense-Thirring effect of a tilted disk can result in a precession period of 16 days for a mass inflow rate of $0.5-1.5\times10^{18}~\rm g\,s^{-1}$, a spin period of 1-20 ms of the pulsar, and an extremely low viscous parameter $\alpha=10^{-8}$ in the disk. The disk mass and the magnetic field of the pulsar are also constrained to be $\sim10^{-3}~\rm M_{\odot}$ and $< 2.5\times 10^{13}~\rm G$. In our model, a new born pulsar with normal magnetic field and millisecond period would successively experience accretion phase, propeller phase, and is visible as a strong radio source in the current stage.

arXiv:2006.01450,Ze-Wei Zhao et al.,Cosmological parameter estimation for dynamical dark energy models with future fast radio burst observations,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a mysterious astrophysical phenomenon of bright pulses emitted at radio frequencies, and they are expected to be frequently detected in the future. The dispersion measures of FRBs are related to cosmological parameters, thus FRBs have the potential to be developed into a new cosmological probe if their data can be largely accumulated in the future. In this work, we study the capability of future FRB data to improve cosmological parameter estimation in two dynamical dark energy models. We find that the simulated FRB data can break the parameter degeneracies inherent in the current cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Therefore, the combination of the CMB and FRB data can significantly improve the constraints on the Hubble constant and dark energy parameters, compared to those using CMB or FRB alone. If 10,000 FRB events with known redshifts are detected in the future, they would perform better than the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in breaking the parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB data. We also find that the combination of FRB and gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren data provides an independent low-redshift probe to verify the results from the CMB and BAO data. For the data combination of CMB, GW, and FRB, it is found that the main contribution to the constraints comes from the CMB and GW data, but the inclusion of the FRB data still can evidently improve the constraint on the baryon density.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2006.00484,Yun-Wei Yu et al.,The confrontation of the shock-powered synchrotron maser model with the Galactic FRB 200428,"The association of FRB 200428 with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 offers important implications for the physical processes responsible for the fast radio burst (FRB) phenomena. By assuming that the XRB emission is produced in the magnetosphere, we investigate the possibility that the FRB emission is produced by shock-powered synchrotron maser (SM), which is phenomenologically described with a plenty of free parameters. The observational constraints on the model parameters indicate that the model can in principle be consistent with the FRB 200428 observations, if the ejecta lunched by magnetar activities can have appropriate ingredients and structures and the shock processes occur on the line of sight. To be specific, a complete burst ejecta should consist of an ultra-relativistic and extremely highly collimated $e^{\pm}$ component and a sub-relativistic and wide-spreading baryonic component. The internal shocks producing the FRB emission arise from a collision between the $e^{\pm}$ ejecta and the remnant of a previous baryonic ejecta at the same direction. The parameter constraints are still dependent on the uncertain spectrum and efficiency of the SM emission. While the spectrum is tentatively described by a spectral index of $-2$, we estimate the emission efficiency to be around $10^{-4}$ by requiring that the synchrotron emission of the shocked material cannot be much brighter than the magnetosphere XRB emission.",astro-ph.HE

Radio single bursts were detected during this activation, strengthening the connection between magnetars and fast radio bursts. We report on the X-ray monitoring of SGR J1935+2154 from ~3 days prior to ~3 weeks after its reactivation, using Swift, NuSTAR, and NICER. We detected X-ray pulsations in the NICER and NuSTAR observations, and constrained the spin period derivative to |Pdot| < 3e-11 s/s (3 sigma c.l.). The pulse profile showed a variable shape switching between single and double-peaked as a function of time and energy. The pulsed fraction decreased from ~34% to ~11% (5-10 keV) over ~10 days. The X-ray spectrum was well fit by an absorbed blackbody model with temperature decreasing from kT ~ 1.6 to 0.45-0.6 keV, plus a non-thermal component (Gamma ~ 1.2) observed up to ~25 keV with NuSTAR. The 0.3-10 keV X-ray luminosity (at 6.6 kpc) increased in less than four days from ~ 6e33 erg/s to about 3e35 erg/s and then decreased again to 2.5e34 erg/s over the following three weeks of the outburst.

Day et al.,High time resolution and polarisation properties of ASKAP-localised fast radio bursts,"Combining high time and frequency resolution full-polarisation spectra of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with knowledge of their host galaxy properties provides an opportunity to study both the emission mechanism generating them and the impact of their propagation through their local environment, host galaxy, and the intergalactic medium. The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope has provided the first ensemble of bursts with this information. In this paper, we present the high time and spectral resolution, full polarisation observations of five localised FRBs to complement the results published for the previously studied ASKAP FRB~181112. We find that every FRB is highly polarised, with polarisation fractions ranging from 80 -- 100\%, and that they are generally dominated by linear polarisation. While some FRBs in our sample exhibit properties associated with an emerging archetype (i.e., repeating or apparently non-repeating), others exhibit characteristic features of both, implying the existence of a continuum of FRB properties. When examined at high time resolution, we find that all FRBs in our sample have evidence for multiple sub-components and for scattering at a level greater than expected from the Milky Way. We find no correlation between the diverse range of FRB properties (e.g., scattering time, intrinsic width, and rotation measure) and any global property of their host galaxy. The most heavily scattered bursts reside in the outskirts of their host galaxies, suggesting that the source-local environment rather than the host interstellar medium is likely the dominant origin of the scattering in our sample.",astro-ph.HE

Macquart et al.,A census of baryons in the Universe from localized fast radio bursts,"More than three quarters of the baryonic content of the Universe resides in a highly diffuse state that is difficult to observe, with only a small fraction directly observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Censuses of the nearby Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy to observe these invisible baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are insensitive to the majority of the volume, and likely mass. Specifically, quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to only the very trace amounts of Hydrogen that exists in the atomic state, or highly ionized and enriched gas in denser regions near galaxies. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses provide evidence of some of the gas in filamentary structures and studies of X-ray emission are most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters. Here we report the direct measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a sample of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), thus utilizing an effect that measures the electron column density along each sight line and accounts for every ionised baryon. We augment the sample of published arcsecond-localized FRBs with a further four new localizations to host galaxies which have measured redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522, completing a sample sufficiently large to account for dispersion variations along the line of sight and in the host galaxy environment to derive a cosmic baryon density of $\Omega_{b} = 0.051_{-0.025}^{+0.021} \, h_{70}^{-1}$ (95% confidence).

We discuss the global properties of the host galaxies of the first four FRBs localized by ASKAP, which lie in the redshift range $0.11<z<0.48$. All four are massive galaxies (log( $M_{*}/ M_{\odot}$) $\sim 9.4 -10.4$) with modest star-formation rates of up to $2M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ -- very different to the host galaxy of the first repeating FRB 121102, which is a dwarf galaxy with a high specific star-formation rate. The FRBs localized by ASKAP typically lie in the outskirts of their host galaxies, which appears to rule out FRB progenitor models that invoke active galactic nuclei (AGN) or free-floating cosmic strings. The stellar population seen in these host galaxies also disfavors models in which all FRBs arise from young magnetars produced by superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), as proposed for the progenitor of FRB 121102. A range of other progenitor models (including compact-object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core-collapse supernovae) remain plausible.",astro-ph.GA

Accurate localisations delivered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey now provide an opportunity to study the host galaxies and potential transient counterparts of FRBs at a large range of wavelengths. In this work, we investigate whether the first three FRBs accurately localised by CRAFT have supernova-like transient counterparts. We obtained two sets of imaging epochs with the Very Large Telescope for three host galaxies, one soon after the burst detection and one several months later. After subtracting these images no optical counterparts were identified in the associated FRB host galaxies, so we instead place limits on the brightness of any potential optical transients. A Monte Carlo approach, in which supernova light curves were modelled and their base properties randomised, was used to estimate the probability of a supernova associated with each FRB going undetected.

Our Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 ultraviolet and visible light image reveals that the subarcsecond localization of FRB~190608 is coincident with a knot of star-formation ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 1.5 \times 10^{-2}~ M_{\odot} \, \rm \, yr^{-1} \, kpc^{-2}$) in the northwest spiral arm of HG~190608. Using H$\beta$ emission present in our Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field spectrum of the galaxy with a surface brightness of $\mu_{\rm H\beta}= \mathrm{(3.36\pm0.21)\times10^{-17}\;erg\;s^{-1}\;cm^{-2}\;arcsec^{-2}}$, we infer an extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ surface brightness and compute a dispersion measure (DM) from the interstellar medium of HG 190608 of $\rm DM_{\rm Host,ISM} = 94 \pm 38~ \;pc\;cm^{-3}$. The galaxy rotates with a circular velocity $v_{\rm circ} = \rm 141 \pm 8~ km\;s^{-1}$ at an inclination $i_{\mathrm{gas}} = 37 \pm 3^\circ$, giving a dynamical mass $M_{\rm halo}^{\rm dyn} \approx 10^{11.96 \pm 0.08}~M_{\odot}$. This implies a halo contribution to the DM of $\rm DM_{\rm Host,Halo}= \rm 55\pm25 \;pc\;cm^{-3}$ subject to assumptions on the density profile and fraction of baryons retained. From the galaxy rotation curve, we infer a bar-induced pattern speed of $\Omega_p=34\pm 6\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}}$ using linear resonance theory. We then calculate the maximum time since star-formation for a progenitor using the furthest distance to the arm's leading edge within the localization, and find $t_{\mathrm{enc}} = 21_{-6}^{+25}$ Myr.

However, the assumption might not be true if, for example, most FRB progenitors are embedded in ionized circumstellar material (CSM, e.g. supernova remnant). In this study, we jointly analyze distributions of DM, flux density, and fluence of the FRB samples observed by the Parkes telescope and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) using analytical models of FRBs, to constrain fractions of various DM components that shape the overall DM distribution and emission properties of FRBs. Comparing the model predictions with the observations we find that the typical amount of DM in each FRB host galaxy is $\sim 120$ cm$^{-3}$pc which is naturally explained as a combination of interstellar medium (ISM) and halo of an ordinary galaxy, without additional contribution from ionized CSM that is directly associated with an FRB progenitor. Furthermore, we also find that observed flux densities of FRBs do not statistically suffer strong $K$-correction, i.e. the typical luminosity density of FRBs does not significantly change within the range of emitting frequency $\nu_{\rm rest} \sim$ 1--4 GHz.",astro-ph.HE

Tavani et al.,An X-Ray Burst from a Magnetar Enlightening the Mechanism of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short (millisecond) radio pulses originating from enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances so far lacking a detection in other energy bands. Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered as the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because of differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar characteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE satellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very bright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected by AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is spectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~ $10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first time that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like radio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit X-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be discovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR 1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of repeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may power the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique occasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on the X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs. Our detection enlightens and constrains the physical process leading to FRBs: contrary to previous expectations, high-brightness temperature radio emission coexists with spectrally-cutoff X-ray radiation.",astro-ph.HE

These observations favor magnetar-based interior-driven models. In this Letter, we propose a different model for FRB 200428 associated with an XRB from SGR 1935+2154, in which a magnetar with high proper velocity encounters an asteroid of mass $\sim10^{20}\,$g. This infalling asteroid in the stellar gravitational field is first possibly disrupted tidally into a great number of fragments at radius $\sim {\rm a\,\,few}$ times $10^{10}\,$cm, and then slowed around the Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n radius by an ultra-strong magnetic field and in the meantime two major fragments of mass $\sim 10^{17}\,$g that cross magnetic field lines produce two pulses of FRB 200428. The whole asteroid is eventually accreted onto the poles along magnetic field lines, impacting the stellar surface, creating a photon-e$^\pm$ pair fireball trapped initially in the stellar magnetosphere, and further leading to an XRB. We show that this gravitationally-powered model can interpret all of the observed features self-consistently.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2005.11479,L. Lin et al.,No pulsed radio emission during a bursting phase of a Galactic magnetar,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients of unknown origin observed at extragalactic distances. It has been long speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far\cite{sun19}. Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active phase by emitting intense soft Gamma-ray bursts. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB 200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs was detected from the source, in association with a soft Gamma-ray / hard X-ray flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard X-rays) data. During the third session, 29 soft Gamma-ray repeater (SGR) bursts were detected in Gamma-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected. The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB -- SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that only under extreme conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2005.11178,A. Ridnaia et al.,A peculiar hard X-ray counterpart of a Galactic fast radio burst,"Fast radio bursts are bright, millisecond-scale radio flashes of yet unknown physical origin. Recently, their extragalactic nature has been demonstrated and an increasing number of the sources have been found to repeat. Young, highly magnetized, isolated neutron stars - magnetars - have been suggested as the most promising candidates for fast radio burst progenitors owing to their energetics and high X-ray flaring activity. Here we report the detection with the Konus-Wind of a hard X-ray event of April 28, 2020, temporarily coincident with a bright, two-peak radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154 with properties remarkably similar to those of fast radio bursts. We show that two peaks of the double-peaked X-ray burst coincide in time with the radio peaks, confirming that the X-ray and radio emission most likely have a common origin. Thus, this is the first simultaneous detection of a fast radio burst from a Galactic magnetar and its high-energy counterpart. The total energy emitted in X-rays in this burst is typical of bright short magnetar bursts, but an unusual hardness of its energy spectrum strongly distinguish the April 28 event among multiple ""ordinary"" flares detected from SGR~1935+2154 previously. This, and a recent non-detection of radio emission from about one hundred typical soft bursts from SGR 1935+2154 favors the idea that bright, FRB-like magnetar signals are associated with rare, hard-spectrum X-ray bursts, which implied rate ($\sim$ 0.04 yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$) appears consistent with the rate estimate of SGR 1935+2154-like radio bursts (0.007 - 0.04 yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$).",astro-ph.HE

Recently, a pair of FRB-like bursts (FRB 200428 hereafter) separated by milliseconds (ms) were detected from the general direction of the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here we report the detection of a non-thermal X-ray burst in the 1-250 keV energy band with the Insight-HXMT satellite, which we identify as emitted from SGR J1935+2154. The burst showed two hard peaks with a separation of 34 ms, broadly consistent with that of the two bursts in FRB 200428. The delay time between the double radio and X-ray peaks is about 8.57 s, fully consistent with the dispersion delay of FRB 200428. We thus identify the non-thermal X-ray burst is associated with FRB 200428 whose high energy counterpart is the two hard peaks in X-ray.

We aim to demonstrate that saliency maps provide the means to understand predictions from machine learning algorithms and can be implemented in piplines used to search for transient events. We have implemented a new deep learning methodology to predict whether or not any segment of the data contains a transient event. The algorithm has been trained using real and simulated data sets. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to identify such events. The output results are visually analysed via the use of saliency maps. We find that saliency maps can produce an enhanced image of any transient feature without the need for de-dispersion or removal of radio frequency interference. Such maps can be used to understand which features in the image were used in making the machine learning decision and to visualise the transient event. Even though the algorithm reported here was developed to demonstrate saliency-map analysis, we have detected, in archival data, a single burst event with dispersion measure of $41$\,cm$^{-3}$pc that is not associated with any currently known pulsar.",astro-ph.IM

Bochenek et al.,A fast radio burst associated with a Galactic magnetar,"Since their discovery in 2007, much effort has been devoted to uncovering the sources of the extragalactic, millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs). A class of neutron star known as magnetars is a leading candidate source of FRBs. Magnetars have surface magnetic fields in excess of $10^{14}$ G, the decay of which powers a range of high-energy phenomena. Here we present the discovery of a millisecond-duration radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, with a fluence of $1.5\pm 0.3$ Mega-Jansky milliseconds. This event, termed ST 200428A(=FRB 200428), was detected on 28 April 2020 by the STARE2 radio array in the 1281--1468\,MHz band. The isotropic-equivalent energy released in ST 200428A is $4\times10^{3}$ times greater than in any Galactic radio burst previously observed on similar timescales. ST 200428A is just 40 times less energetic than the weakest extragalactic FRB observed to date, and is arguably drawn from the same population as the observed FRB sample. The coincidence of ST 200428A with an X-ray burst favours emission models developed for FRBs that describe synchrotron masers or electromagnetic pulses powered by magnetar bursts and giant flares. The discovery of ST 200428A implies that active magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 can produce FRBs at extragalactic distances. The high volumetric rate of events like ST 200428A motivates dedicated searches for similar bursts from nearby galaxies.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2005.10324,The CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.,A bright millisecond-duration radio burst from a Galactic magnetar,"Magnetars are highly magnetized young neutron stars that occasionally produce enormous bursts and flares of X-rays and gamma-rays. Of the approximately thirty magnetars currently known in our Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, five have exhibited transient radio pulsations. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves arriving from cosmological distances. Some have been seen to repeat. A leading model for repeating FRBs is that they are extragalactic magnetars, powered by their intense magnetic fields. However, a challenge to this model has been that FRBs must have radio luminosities many orders of magnitude larger than those seen from known Galactic magnetars. Here we report the detection of an extremely intense radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project. The fluence of this two-component bright radio burst and the estimated distance to SGR 1935+2154 together imply a 400-800 MHz burst energy of $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg, which is three orders of magnitude brighter than those of any radio-emitting magnetar detected thus far. Such a burst coming from a nearby galaxy would be indistinguishable from a typical FRB. This event thus bridges a large fraction of the radio energy gap between the population of Galactic magnetars and FRBs, strongly supporting the notion that magnetars are the origin of at least some FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Each of the millions of fragments of the ultra-relativistic QN ejecta provides a collisionless plasma for which the ambient medium (galactic/halo, the intra-group/intra-cluster medium) acts as a relativistic plasma beam. The Buneman and the Weibel instabilities, successively induced by the beam in the fragment, generate particle bunching and observed coherent emission at GHz frequency with a corresponding fluence in the Jy ms range. The duration, frequency drift and the rate are in agreement with observed properties of FRBs. Repeats (on timescales of minutes to months) are due to seeing multiple fragments each beaming at a different direction and coming in at different times. Single (non-repeating) FRBs, occur when only emission from the primary fragment is within the detector's sensitivity. Key properties of FRB 121102 (its years of activity) and of FRB 180916.J0158+65 (its 16 day period) are recovered.

Light dark photons (DP) may comprise partially or entirely the observed DM density and existing limits on the DP DM parameter space arise from several cosmological and astrophysical sources. In the present work we investigate DP DM using cosmic transients, specifically fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observed time delay of radio photons with different energies have been used to constrain the photon mass or the Weak Equivalence Principle, for example. Due to the mixing between the visible and the DP, the time delay of photons from these cosmic transients, caused by free electrons in the intergalactic medium, can change and impact those constraints from FRBs. We use five detected FRBs and two associations of FRBs with gamma-ray bursts to investigate the correspondent variation on the time delay caused by the presence of DP DM. The result is virtually independent of the FRB used and this variation is very small, considering the still allowed DP DM parameter space, not jeopardizing current bounds on other contributions of the observed time delay.",astro-ph.CO

In contrast to rotation-powered pulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution and decay of their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray emission, but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We report the discovery of bright, persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE J1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar behavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time periods following a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were detected outside of a flaring state. They are less energetic and display temporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events previously observed from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts. Our high frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out simultaneously with the X-ray observations, demonstrate that the relative alignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational timescales. No correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the X-ray and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency structure, which was not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9 GHz. Many of the radio pulses were also not detected simultaneously at both frequencies, which indicates that the underlying emission mechanism producing these pulses is not broadband. We find that the radio pulses from XTE J1810-197 share similar characteristics to radio bursts detected from fast radio burst (FRB) sources, some of which are now thought to be produced by active magnetars.",astro-ph.HE

In this work, we explore detectability of radio afterglows from BNS mergers and compare it to the observed radio limits on FRB afterglows. We calculate the afterglow flux powered by the two components: a relativistic jet and a slower isotropic ejecta, and quantify the detection probability as a function of the source redshift, observing time, and flux sensitivity. The model parameter distributions inferred from short GRB afterglows are adopted, and viewing angle distributions (uniform spherical, gravitational-wave, on-axis biased) are assumed to reflect different searching scenario. Assuming that FRBs are not strongly beamed, we make comparison to FRBs detected with reported radio limits and find the detection probabilities are 1--10% in general, and hence not a strong constraint on the BNS progenitor model considering the small sample number (<10). In particular for some nearby FRBs (e.g. 180916.J0158+65, 190608), we find a high chance of detection (>20% at 10$\mu$Jy sensitivity) for the isotropic component that would peak around $\sim$1--10 years after the merger.

We show that the volumetric rate of Galactic-FRB like events is consistent with the faint end of the cosmological FRB rate, and hence they most likely belong to the same class of transients. The Galactic FRB had an accompanying X-ray burst but many X-ray bursts from the same object had no radio counterpart. Their relative rates suggest that for every FRB there are roughly 10^2 to 10^3 X-ray bursts. The radio lightcurve of the galactic FRB had two spikes separated by 30 ms in the 400-800 MHz frequency band. This is an important clue and highly constraining of the class of models where the radio emission is produced outside the light-cylinder of the magnetar. We suggest that magnetic disturbances close to the magnetar surface propagate to a distance of a few tens of neutron star radii where they damp and produce radio emission. The coincident hard X-ray spikes associated with the two FRB pulses seen in this burst and the flux ratio between the two frequency bands can be understood in this scenario. This model provides a unified picture for faint bursts like the Galactic FRB as well as the bright events seen at cosmological distances.",astro-ph.HE

Several short bursts with fluence of $\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ were detected by the IBIS instrument in the 20-200 keV range. The burst with the hardest spectrum, discovered and localized in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, was spatially and temporally coincident with a short and very bright radio burst detected by the CHIME and STARE2 radio telescopes at 400-800 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively. Its lightcurve shows three narrow peaks separated by $\sim$29 ms time intervals, superimposed on a broad pulse lasting $\sim$0.6 s. The brightest peak had a delay of 6.5$\pm$1.0 ms with respect to the 1.4 GHz radio pulse (that coincides with the second and brightest component seen at lower frequencies). The burst spectrum, an exponentially cut-off power law with photon index $\Gamma=0.7_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$ and peak energy $E_p=65\pm5$ keV, is harder than those of the bursts usually observed from this and other magnetars. By the analysis of an expanding dust scattering ring seen in X-rays with the {\it Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} XRT instrument, we derived a distance of 4.4$_{-1.3}^{+2.8}$ kpc for SGR 1935+2154, independent of its possible association with the supernova remnant G57.2+0.8. At this distance, the burst 20-200 keV fluence of $(6.1\pm 0.3)\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ corresponds to an isotropic emitted energy of $\sim1.4\times10^{39}$ erg. This is the first burst with a radio counterpart observed from a soft $\gamma$-ray repeater and it strongly supports models based on magnetars that have been proposed for extragalactic fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Meanwhile, wide-field instruments such as the 47 deg$^2$ Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey the optical sky to study transient and variable sources. We present serendipitous ZTF observations of the CHIME repeating source FRB 180916.J0158+65, that was localized to a spiral galaxy 149 Mpc away and is the first FRB suggesting periodic modulation in its activity. While 147 ZTF exposures corresponded to expected high-activity periods of this FRB, no single ZTF exposure was at the same time as a CHIME detection. No $>3\sigma$ optical source was found at the FRB location in 683 ZTF exposures, totalling 5.69 hours of integration time. We combined ZTF upper limits and expected repetitions from FRB 180916.J0158+65 in a statistical framework using a Weibull distribution, agnostic of periodic modulation priors. The analysis yielded a constraint on the ratio between the optical and radio fluences of $\eta \lesssim 200$, corresponding to an optical energy $E_{\rm opt} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{46}$ erg for a fiducial 10 Jy ms FRB (90% confidence). A deeper (but less statistically robust) constraint of $\eta \lesssim 3$ can be placed assuming a rate of $r(>5$ Jy ms)= hr$^{-1}$ and $1.2\pm 1.1$ FRB occurring during exposures taken in high-activity windows. The constraint can be improved with shorter per-image exposures and longer integration time, or observing FRBs at higher Galactic latitudes.

We model these distributions, correcting for the Galactic interstellar medium, with kernel density estimation---well-suited to the small data regime---to find lower/upper bounds to the corrected $\text{DM}_\text{pulsar}$/$\text{DM}_\text{FRB}$ distributions: $\max[\text{DM}_\text{pulsar}] \approx 7\pm2 \text{ (stat)} \pm 9 \text{ (sys) pc cm}^{-3}$ and $\min[\text{DM}_\text{FRB}] \approx 63^{+27}_{-21} \text{ (stat)} \pm 9 \text{ (sys) pc cm}^{-3}$. Using bootstrap resampling to estimate uncertainties, we set conservative limits on the Galactic halo dispersion measure $-2 < \text{DM}_\text{MW,halo} < 123 \text{pc cm}^{-3}$ (95\% c.l.). The upper limit is especially conservative because it may include a non-negligible contribution from the FRB host galaxies and a non-zero contribution from the cosmic web. It strongly disfavors models where the Galaxy has retained the majority of its baryons with a density profile tracking the presumed dark matter density profile. Last, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of larger FRB samples to validate our technique and assess the sensitivity of ongoing and future surveys. We recover bounds of several tens $\text{pc cm}^{-3}$ which may be sufficient to test whether the Galaxy has retained a majority of its baryonic mass.

Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB sources, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the radio emission which make different predictions for the accompanying higher frequency radiation. We show that the properties of the coincident radio and X-ray flares from SGR 1935+2154, including their approximate simultaneity and relative fluence $E_{\rm radio}/E_{\rm X} \sim 10^{-5}$, as well as the duration and spectrum of the X-ray emission, are consistent with extant predictions for the synchrotron maser shock model. Rather than arising from the inner magnetosphere, the X-rays are generated by (incoherent) synchrotron radiation from thermal electrons heated at the same shocks which produce the coherent maser emission. Although the rate of SGR 1935+2154-like bursts in the local universe is not sufficient to contribute appreciably to the extragalactic FRB rate, the inclusion of an additional population of more active magnetars with stronger magnetic fields than the Galactic population can explain both the FRB rate as well as the repeating fraction, however only if the population of active magnetars are born at a rate that is at least two-orders of magnitude lower than that of SGR 1935+2154-like magnetars.

We propose an explanation of the temporal- and frequency-properties of sub-pulses of repeating FRBs based on the generic geometry within the framework of charged-bunching coherent curvature radiation in the magnetosphere of an NS. The sub-pulses in a radio burst come from bunches of charged particles moving along different magnetic field lines. Their radiation beam sweep across the line of sight at slightly different time, and those radiating at the more curved part tend to be seen earlier and at higher frequency. However, by considering bunches generated at slightly different times, we find there is also a small probability that the emission from the less curved part be seen earlier. We simulate the time--frequency structures by deriving various forms of the electric acceleration field in the magnetosphere. Such structure of sub-pulses is a natural consequence of coherent curvature radiation from an NS magnetosphere with suddenly and violently triggered sparks. We apply this model to explain the time--frequency structure within specific dipolar configuration by invoking the transient pulsar-like sparking from the inner gap of a slowly rotating NS, and have also developed in more generic configurations.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, we propose that the persistent emission is produced via synchrotron-heating process by multiple bursts of FRB 121102 in a self-absorbed synchrotron nebula. As a population of bursts of the repeating FRB absorbed by the synchrotron nebula, the energy distribution of electrons in the nebula will change significantly. As a result, the spectrum of the nebula will show a hump steadily. For the persistent emission of FRB 121102, the total energy of bursts injecting into the nebula is required to be about $3.3\times10^{49}\,\unit{erg}$, the burst injection age is over $6.7\times 10^4\,\unit{yr}$, the nebula size is $\sim0.02\,\unit{pc}$, and the electron number is about $3.2\times10^{55}$. We predict that as more bursts inject, the brightness of the nebula would be brighter than the current observation, and meanwhile, the peak frequency would become higher.

We test such a hypothesis by systematically searching for GRB-FRB spatial associations from 110 FRBs and 1440 GRBs. We find that one FRB event, FRB 171209, discovered by the Parkes telescope is spatially coincident with a historical long-duration GRB 110715A at $z=0.82$. The afterglow of GRB 110715A is consistent with being powered by a millisecond magnetar. The extragalactic dispersion measure of FRB 171209 is in excess of that contributed by the intergalactic medium, which can be interpreted as being contributed by a young supernova remnant associated with the GRB. Overall, the significance of the association is $(2.28 - 2.55) \sigma$. If the association is indeed physical, our result suggests that the magnetars associated with long GRBs can be the progenitors of at least some FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Pen, ",Cosmology with gravitationally lensed repeating Fast Radio Bursts,"High-precision cosmological probes have revealed a small but significant tension between the parameters measured with different techniques, among which there is one based on time delays in gravitational lenses. We discuss a new way of using time delays for cosmology, taking advantage of the extreme precision expected for lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are short flashes of radio emission originating at cosmological distances. With coherent methods, the achievable precision is sufficient for measuring how time delays change over the months and years, which can also be interpreted as differential redshifts between the images. It turns out that uncertainties arising from the unknown mass distribution of gravitational lenses can be eliminated by combining time delays with their time derivatives. Other effects, most importantly relative proper motions, can be measured accurately and disentangled from the cosmological effects. With a mock sample of simulated lenses, we show that it may be possible to attain strong constraints on cosmological parameters. Finally, the lensed images can be used as galactic interferometer to resolve structures and motions of the burst sources with incredibly high resolution and help reveal their physical nature, which is currently unknown.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2004.11276,"Ji-Ping Dai, Jun-Qing Xia, ",Reconstruction of Reionization History through Dispersion Measure of Fast Radio Bursts,"In this paper, we study the evolution of the ionization fraction $x_e(z)$ during the epoch of reionization by using the dispersion measurements (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Different from the previous studies, here we turn to consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog, which only needs the rough redshift distribution, instead of the exact redshift information of each FRB. Firstly, we consider the instantaneous ``\texttt{tanh}'' model for $x_e(z)$ and find that including the auto-correlation information of the mock catalog, about $10^4$ FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of 100 $\rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 20\% of all sky, could significantly improve the constraint on the width $\Delta_z$ of the model, when comparing with that from the CMB data alone. The evolution shape of the ionization fraction will be tightly narrowed, namely the duration of the epoch of reionization has been shrunk, $z_{\rm dur}<2.24$ (95\% C.L.). Furthermore, we also use another redshift-asymmetric reionization model and obtain that the FRB mock catalog could measure the ionization fraction at $z=6$ precisely with the $1\sigma$ error $\Delta x_e(z=6)=0.012$, which means that the large-scale clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the ionization fraction of the end of reionization epoch. We conclude that the observation of high-redshift FRBs could be a complementary probe to study the reionization history in the future.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:2004.11223,Shuang Du et al.,The geometry and environment of repeating FRBs,"We propose a geometrical explanation for periodically and nonperiodically repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) under neutron star (NS)-companion systems. We suggest a constant critical binary separation, $r_{\rm c}$, within which the interaction between the NS and companion can trigger FRB bursts. For an elliptic orbit with the minimum and maximum binary separations, $r_{\rm min}$ and $r_{\rm max}$, a periodically repeating FRB with an active period could be reproduced if $r_{\rm min}<r_{\rm c}<r_{\rm max}$. However, if $r_{\rm max}<r_{\rm c}$, the modulation of orbital motion will not work due to persistent interaction, and this kind of repeating FRBs should be nonperiodic. We test relevant NS-companion binary scenarios on the basis of FRB 180916.J0158+65 and FRB 121102 under this geometrical frame. It is found that the pulsar-asteroid belt impact model is more suitable to explain these two FRBs since this model is compatible with different companions (e.g., massive stars and black holes). At last, we point out that FRB 121102-like samples are potential objects which can reveal the evolution of star-forming region.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2004.10787,"Ge Chen, Vikram Ravi, Wenbin Lu, ",The multiwavelength counterparts of fast radio bursts,"The engines that produce extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs), and the mechanism by which the emission is generated, remain unknown. Many FRB models predict prompt multi-wavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no detections, and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to estimate the ratio, $\eta$, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands. We present constraints on $\eta$ that improve upon previous observations even in the case that all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for $\eta$. However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking amongst catalogs of unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to accurately estimate or bound $\eta$ will require the careful analysis of all candidate fast-transient events in multi-wavelength survey data sets.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2004.08393,Zhengxiang Li et al.,Cosmology-insensitive estimate of IGM baryon mass fraction from five localized fast radio bursts,"Five fast radio bursts (FRBs), including three apparently non-repeating ones FRB 180924, FRB 181112, and FRB 190523, and two repeaters, FRB 121102 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, have already been localized so far. We apply a method developed recently by us (Li et al. 2019) to these five localized FRBs to give a cosmology-insensitive estimate of the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$. Using the measured dispersion measure (DM) and luminosity distance $d_{\rm L}$ data (inferred from the FRB redshifts and $d_{\rm L}$ of type Ia supernovae at the same redshifts) of the five FRBs, we constrain the local $f_{\rm IGM} = 0.84^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ with no evidence of redshift dependence. This cosmology-insensitive estimate of $f_{\rm IGM}$ from FRB observations is in excellent agreement with previous constraints using other probes. Moreover, using the three apparently non-repeating FRBs only we get a little looser but consistent result $f_{\rm IGM} = 0.74^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$. In these two cases, reasonable estimations for the host galaxy DM contribution (${\rm DM_{host}}$) can be achieved by modelling it as a function of star formation rate. The constraints on both $f_{\rm IGM}$ and ${\rm DM_{host}}$ are expected to be significantly improved with the rapid progress in localizing FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

These spectral features may provide insight into the emission mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts, or they could possibly be explained by extrinsic propagation effects in the local environment. Broadband observations can better quantify this behavior and help to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects. We present results from a simultaneous 2.25 and 8.36 GHz observation of the repeating FRB 121102 using the 70 m Deep Space Network (DSN) radio telescope, DSS-43. During the 5.7 hr continuous observing session, we detected 6 bursts from FRB 121102, which were visible in the 2.25 GHz frequency band. However, none of these bursts were detected in the 8.36 GHz band, despite the larger bandwidth and greater sensitivity in the higher-frequency band. This effect is not explainable by Galactic scintillation and, along with previous multi-band experiments, clearly demonstrates that apparent burst activity depends strongly on the radio frequency band that is being observed.",astro-ph.HE

During 33 ks of Chandra observations, we detect no radio bursts in overlapping Effelsberg or Deep Space Network observations and a single radio burst during CHIME/FRB source transits. We detect no X-ray events in excess of the background during the Chandra observations. These non-detections imply a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $<5\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for the 0.5--10 keV fluence of prompt emission at the time of the radio burst and $1.3\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at any time during the Chandra observations at the position of FRB 180916.J0158+65. Given the host-galaxy redshift of FRB 180916.J0158+65 ($z\sim0.034$), these correspond to energy limits of $<1.6\times10^{45}$ erg and $<4\times10^{45}$ erg, respectively. We also place a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $<8\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10\,keV absorbed flux of a persistent source at the location of FRB 180916.J0158+65. This corresponds to a luminosity limit of $<2\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using Fermi/GBM data we search for prompt gamma-ray emission at the time of radio bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65 and find no significant bursts, placing a limit of $4\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ on the 10--100 keV fluence. We also search Fermi/LAT data for periodic modulation of the gamma-ray brightness at the 16.35-day period of radio-burst activity and detect no significant modulation. We compare these deep limits to the predictions of various fast radio burst models, but conclude that similar X-ray constraints on a closer fast radio burst source would be needed to strongly constrain theory.",astro-ph.HE

After accounting for the dispersion smearing across the channel bandwidth and the sky regions surveyed, the number of FRBs is found to be consistent with model predictions.

In an effort to find other repeating FRBs, FIRST J141918.9+394036 (hereafter FIRST J1419+3940) was identified in a search for similar persistent radio sources in dwarf host galaxies. FIRST J1419+3940 was subsequently identified as a radio transient decaying on timescales of decades, and it has been argued that it is the orphan afterglow of a long gamma-ray burst. FIRST J1419+3940 and FRB 121102's persistent radio source show observational similarities, though the latter appears to be stable in brightness. Nonetheless, if they have similar physical origins, then FIRST J1419+3940 may also contain a source capable of producing fast radio bursts. We report the non-detection of short-duration radio bursts from FIRST J1419+3940 during 3.1 h of observations with the 110-m Green Bank Telescope at both 2 and 6 GHz. FIRST J1419+3940 is 11 times closer compared with FRB 121102, and exhibits an optically-thin synchrotron spectrum above 1.4GHz; our search was thus sensitive to bursts more than 100 times weaker than those seen from FRB 121102. We encourage future burst searches to constrain the possible presence of an FRB-emitting source. Although such searches are high-risk, any such detection could greatly elucidate the origins of the FRB phenomenon.",astro-ph.HE

We report on the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations of FRB 180916 obtained by AGILE and Swift. We focused on the recurrent 5-day time intervals of active radio bursting and present results obtained on Feb. 3 - 8; Feb. 25; Mar. 5 - 10; Mar. 22 - 28, 2020 during a multiwavelength campaign involving high-energy and radio observations. We also searched for temporal coincidences at millisecond timescales between all known radio bursts of FRB 180916 and X-ray and MeV events detectable by AGILE. We do not detect any simultaneous event or any extended X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission on timescales of hours/days/weeks. Our cumulative X-ray (0.3-10 keV) flux upper limit of $5 \times\,10^{-14} \rm \, erg \, cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (obtained during 5-day active intervals) translates into an isotropic luminosity upper limit of $L_{X,UL} \sim 1.5 \times\, 10^{41} \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Observations above 100 MeV over a many-year timescale provide an average luminosity upper limit one order of magnitude larger. These results provide the so-far most stringent limits on high-energy emission from FRB 180916 and constrain the dissipation of magnetic energy from a magnetar-like source of radius $R_m$, internal magnetic field $B_m$ and dissipation timescale $\tau_d$ to satisfy the relation $R_{m,6}^3 B_{m,16}^2 \tau_{d,8}^{-1} \lesssim 1$, where $R_{m,6}$ is $R_m$ in units of $10^6$ cm, $B_{m,16}$ is $B_m$ in units of $10^{16}$ G, and $\tau_{d,8}$ in units of $10^8$ s.",astro-ph.HE

Emission in multiple bursts is visible down to the bottom of the GBT band, suggesting that the cutoff frequency (if it exists) for FRB emission is lower than 300 MHz. Observations were conducted during predicted periods of activity of the source, and had simultaneous coverage with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the FRB backend on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find that one of the GBT-detected bursts has potentially associated emission in the CHIME band (400-800 MHz) but we detect no bursts in the LOFAR band (110-190 MHz), placing a limit of $\alpha > -1.0$ on the spectral index of broadband emission from the source. We also find that emission from the source is severely band-limited with burst bandwidths as low as $\sim$40 MHz. In addition, we place the strictest constraint on observable scattering of the source, $<$ 1.7 ms, at 350 MHz, suggesting that the circumburst environment does not have strong scattering properties. Additionally, knowing that the circumburst environment is optically thin to free-free absorption at 300 MHz, we find evidence against the association of a hyper-compact HII region or a young supernova remnant (age $<$ 50 yr) with the source.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2004.02079,Tetsuya Hashimoto et al.,Luminosity-duration relations and luminosity functions of repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio bursts with a time scale of approximately milliseconds. Two populations of FRB, namely repeating and non-repeating FRBs, are observationally identified. However, the differences between these two and their origins are still cloaked in mystery. Here we show the time-integrated luminosity-duration ($L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$) relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in the FRB Catalogue project. These two populations are obviously separated in the $L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$ plane with distinct LFs, i.e., repeating FRBs have relatively fainter $L_{\nu}$ and longer $w_{\rm int,rest}$ with a much lower LF. In contrast with non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs do not show any clear correlation between $L_{\nu}$ and $w_{\rm int,rest}$. These results suggest essentially different physical origins of the two. The faint ends of the LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. This indicates two possibilities: either (i) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in neutron-star mergers or AIC and are actually repeating during the lifetime of the progenitor, or (ii) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in any of SGRs, type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. The bright ends of LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors, suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in unknown progenitors.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2004.00645,"Pawan Kumar, Wenbin Lu, ",Radiation Forces Constrain the FRB Mechanism,"We provide constraints on Fast Radio Burst (FRB) models by careful considerations of radiation forces associated with these powerful transients. We find that the induced-Compton scatterings of the coherent radiation by electrons/positrons accelerate particles to very large Lorentz factors (LF) in and around the source of this radiation. This severely restricts those models for FRBs that invoke relativistic shocks and maser type instabilities at distances less than about $10^{13}$ cm of the neutron star. Radiation traveling upstream, in these models, forces particles to move away from the shock with a LF larger than the LF of the shock front. This suspends the photon generation process after it has been operating for less than ~0.1 ms (observer frame duration). We show that masers operating in shocks at distances larger than $10^{13}$ cm cannot simultaneously account for the burst duration of 1 ms or more and the observed ~1 GHz frequencies of FRBs without requiring an excessive energy budget ($10^{46}$ erg); the energy is not calculated by imposing any efficiency consideration, or other details, for the maser mechanism, but is entirely the result of ensuring that particle acceleration by induced-Compton forces upstream of the shock front does not choke off the maser process. For the source to operate more or less continuously for a few ms, it should be embedded in a strong magnetic field - cyclotron frequency $\gg$ wave frequency - so that radiation forces do not disperse the plasma and shut-off the engine.",astro-ph.HE

The pipeline makes use of a state-of-the-art deep learning classifier to winnow down the very large number of false positive single-pulse candidates that mostly result from radio frequency interference. In our observations totalling 156.5 days so far, we have detected individual pulses from 20 known radio pulsars which provide an excellent verification of the system performance. We also demonstrate, through blind injection analyses, that our pipeline is complete down to a signal-to-noise threshold of 12. Depending on the observing mode, this translates to peak flux sensitivities in the range 0.14--0.89~Jy. Although no FRBs have been detected to date, we have used our results to update the analysis of Lawrence et al. to constrain the FRB all-sky rate to be $1140^{+200}_{-180}$ per day above a peak flux density of 1~Jy. We also constrain the source count index $\alpha=0.83\pm0.06$ which indicates that the source count distribution is substantially flatter than expected from a Euclidean distribution of standard candles (where $\alpha=1.5$). We discuss this result in the context of the FRB redshift and luminosity distributions.

In this Letter, we for the first time apply this method to real data and give constraints of the nature of COs with currently available FRB observations. We emphasize the information from dynamic spectra of FRBs is quite necessary for identifying any lensed signals and find no echoes in the existing data. The null search gives a constraint comparable to that from galactic wide binaries, though the methods of redshift inference from dispersion measure would impact a little. Furthermore, we make an improved forecast basing on the distributions of real data for the ongoing and upcoming telescopes. Finally, we discuss the situation where one or more lensed signals will be detected. In such a case, the parameter space of COs can be pinned down very well since the lens mass can be directly determined through the observed flux ratio and time delay between split images.",astro-ph.CO

The SRT observed the periodic repeater FRB 180916 for five days from 2020 February 20 to 24 during a time interval of active radio bursting, and detected the three bursts during the first hour of observations; no more bursts were detected during the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT observations at 1548 MHz did not detect any bursts. Burst fluences are in the range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these bursts. We also present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign we performed on FRB 180916, during the five days of the active window. Simultaneously with the SRT observations, others with different time spans were performed with the Northern Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER, INTEGRAL, AGILE, and with the TNG and two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast photometers. XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the SRT, and determined a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of ~$10^{45}$ erg/s for the burst emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously with the first burst and determined a fluence upper limit in the MeV range for millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$.Our results show that absorption from the circumburst medium does not significantly affect the emission from FRB 180916, thus limiting the possible presence of a superluminous supernova around the source, and indicate that a cutoff for the bursting mechanism, if present, must be at lower frequencies. Our multi-wavelength campaign sensitively constrains the broadband emission from FRB 180916, and provides the best limits so far for the electromagnetic response to the radio bursting of this remarkable source of fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2003.12581,"Wenbin Lu, Anthony L. Piro, Eli Waxman, ",Implications of CHIME repeating fast radio bursts,"CHIME has now detected 18 repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore what can be learned about the energy distribution and activity level of the repeaters by fitting realistic FRB population models to the data. For a power-law energy distribution dN/dE ~ E^{-\gamma} for the repeating bursts, there is a critical index \gamma_c that controls whether the dispersion measure (DM, a proxy for source distance) distribution of repeaters is bottom or top-heavy. We find \gamma_c = 7/4 for Poisson wait-time distribution of repeaters in Euclidean space and further demonstrate how it is affected by temporal clustering of repetitions and cosmological effects. It is especially interesting that two of the CHIME repeaters (FRB 181017 and 190417) have large DM ~ 1000 pc/cm^3. These can be understood if: (i) the energy distribution is shallow \gamma = 1.7^{+0.3}_{-0.1} (68% confidence) or (ii) a small fraction of sources are extremely active. In the second scenario, these two high-DM sources should be repeating more than 100 times more frequently than FRB 121102, and the energy index is constrained to be \gamma = 1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2} (68% confidence). In either case, this \gamma is consistent with the energy dependence of the non-repeating ASKAP sample, which suggests that they are drawn from the same population. Finally, our model predicts how the CHIME repeating fraction should decrease with redshift, and this can be compared with observations to infer the distribution of activity level in the whole population.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2003.12509,"Paz Beniamini, Zorawar Wadiasingh, Brian D. Metzger, ",Periodicity in recurrent fast radio bursts and the origin of ultra long period magnetars,"The recurrent fast radio burst FRB 180916 was recently shown to exhibit a 16 day period (with possible aliasing) in its bursting activity. Given magnetars as widely considered FRB sources, this period has been attributed to precession of the magnetar spin axis or the orbit of a binary companion. Here, we make the simpler connection to a {\it rotational period}, an idea observationally motivated by the 6.7 hour period of the Galactic magnetar candidate, 1E 161348--5055. We explore three physical mechanisms that could lead to the creation of ultra long period magnetars: (i) enhanced spin-down due to episodic mass-loaded charged particle winds (e.g. as may accompany giant flares), (ii) angular momentum kicks from giant flares and (iii) fallback leading to long lasting accretion disks. We show that particle winds and fallback accretion can potentially lead to a sub-set of the magnetar population with ultra long periods, sufficiently long to accommodate FRB 180916 or 1E 161348--5055. If confirmed, such periods implicate magnetars in relatively mature states (ages $1-10$ kyr) and which possessed large internal magnetic fields at birth $B_{\rm int}\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G. In the low-twist magnetar model for FRBs, such long period magnetars may dominate FRB production for repeaters at lower isotropic-equivalent energies and broaden the energy distribution beyond that expected for a canonical population of magnetars which terminate their magnetic activity at shorter periods $P \lesssim 10$ s.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2003.11930,"L. Connor, M. C. Miller, D. W. Gardenier, ",Beaming as an explanation of the repetition/width relation in FRBs,"It is currently not known if repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fundamentally different from those that have not been seen to repeat. One striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a static bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width. Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks, where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale, volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology.",astro-ph.HE

We planned on searching for prompt gamma-ray counterparts in the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) data, taking advantage of the unique combination of large effective area in the keV-MeV energy range and of sub-ms time resolution. We selected 39 FRBs that were promptly visible from the High-Energy (HE) instrument aboard Insight-HXMT. After calculating the expected arrival times at the location of the spacecraft, we searched for a significant excess in both individual and cumulative time profiles over a wide range of time resolutions, from several seconds down to sub-ms scales. Using the dispersion measures in excess of the Galactic terms, we estimated the upper limits on the redshifts. No convincing signal was found and for each FRB we constrained the gamma-ray isotropic-equivalent luminosity and the released energy as a function of emission timescale. For the nearest FRB source, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, we find $L_{\gamma,iso}<5.5\times 10^{47}$ erg/s over 1 s, whereas $L_{\gamma,iso}<10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg/s for the bulk of FRBs. The same values scale up by a factor of ~100 for a ms-long emission. Even on a timescale comparable with that of the radio pulse itself no keV-MeV emission is observed. A systematic association with either long or short GRBs is ruled out with high confidence, except for subluminous events, as is the case for core-collapse of massive stars (long) or binary neutron star mergers (short) viewed off axis. Only giant flares from extra-galactic magnetars at least ten times more energetic than Galactic siblings are ruled out for the nearest FRB.",astro-ph.HE

Some of the emitted axions are converted to photons by magnetic fields as they travel along the line of sight to Earth. An impulsive burst of axion emission generates a photon signal typically lasting for milliseconds and varying with frequency in the observed manner.

arXiv:2003.04848,Rui Luo et al.,On the FRB luminosity function -- II. Event rate density,"The luminosity function of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), defined as the event rate per unit cosmic co-moving volume per unit luminosity, may help to reveal the possible origins of FRBs and design the optimal searching strategy. With the Bayesian modelling, we measure the FRB luminosity function using 46 known FRBs. Our Bayesian framework self-consistently models the selection effects, including the survey sensitivity, the telescope beam response, and the electron distributions from Milky Way / the host galaxy / local environment of FRBs. Different from the previous companion paper, we pay attention to the FRB event rate density and model the event counts of FRB surveys based on the Poisson statistics. Assuming a Schechter luminosity function form, we infer (at the 95% confidence level) that the characteristic FRB event rate density at the upper cut-off luminosity $L^*=2.9_{-1.7}^{+11.9}\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$ is $\phi^*=339_{-313}^{+1074}\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$, the power-law index is $\alpha=-1.79_{-0.35}^{+0.31}$, and the lower cut-off luminosity is $L_0\le9.1\times10^{41}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$. The event rate density of FRBs is found to be $3.5_{-2.4}^{+5.7}\times10^4\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$ above $10^{42}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$, $5.0_{-2.3}^{+3.2}\times10^3\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$ above $10^{43}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$, and $3.7_{-2.0}^{+3.5}\times10^2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$ above $10^{44}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$. As a result, we find that, for searches conducted at 1.4 GHz, the optimal diameter of single-dish radio telescopes to detect FRBs is 30-40 m. The possible astrophysical implications of the measured event rate density are also discussed in the current paper.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, we suggest that FRB 180916.J0158+65-like periodic FRBs would provide a unique probe of extragalactic asteroid belts (EABs), based on our previously-proposed pulsar-EAB impact model, in which repeating FRBs arise from an old-aged, slowly-spinning, moderately-magnetized pulsar traveling through an EAB around another stellar-mass object. These two objects form a binary and thus the observed period is in fact the orbital period. We show that this model can be used to well interpret all of the observed data of FRB 180916.J0158+65. Furthermore, we constrain the EAB's physical properties and find that (1) the outer radius of the EAB is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of its analogue in the solar system, (2) the differential size distribution of the EAB's asteroids at small diameters (large diameters) is shallower (steeper) than that of solar-system small objects, and (3) the two belts have a comparable mass.",astro-ph.HE

Rajwade et al.,Possible periodic activity in the repeating FRB 121102,"The discovery that at least some Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) repeat has ruled out cataclysmic events as the progenitors of these particular bursts. FRB~121102 is the most well-studied repeating FRB but despite extensive monitoring of the source, no underlying pattern in the repetition has previously been identified. Here, we present the results from a radio monitoring campaign of FRB~121102 using the 76-m Lovell telescope. Using the pulses detected in the Lovell data along with pulses from the literature, we report a detection of periodic behaviour of the source over the span of five years of data. We predict that the source is currently `off' and that it should turn `on' for the approximate MJD range $59002-59089$ (2020-06-02 to 2020-08-28). This result, along with the recent detection of periodicity from another repeating FRB, highlights the need for long-term monitoring of repeating FRBs at a high cadence. Using simulations, we show that one needs at least 100 hours of telescope time to follow-up repeating FRBs at a cadence of 0.5--3 days to detect periodicities in the range of 10--150 days. If the period is real, it shows that repeating FRBs can have a large range in their activity periods that might be difficult to reconcile with neutron star precession models.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2003.02706,Kelly Gourdji et al.,Constraining a neutron star merger origin for localized fast radio bursts,"What the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, and whether there are multiple types of progenitors are open questions. The advent of localized FRBs with host galaxy redshifts allows the various emission models to be directly tested for the first time. Given the recent localizations of two non-repeating FRBs (FRB 180924 and FRB 190523), we discuss a selection of FRB emission models and demonstrate how we can place constraints on key model parameters like the magnetic field strength and age of the putative FRB-emitting neutron star. In particular, we focus on models related to compact binary merger events involving at least one neutron star, motivated by commonalities between the host galaxies of the FRBs and the hosts of such merger events/short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). We rule out the possibility that either FRB was produced during the final inspiral stage of a merging binary system. Where possible, we predict the light curve of electromagnetic emission associated with a given model and use it to recommend multi-wavelength follow-up strategies that may help confirm or rule out models for future FRBs. In addition, we conduct a targeted sub-threshold search in Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for potential SGRB candidates associated with either FRB, and show what a non-detection means for relevant models. The methodology presented in this study may be easily applied to future localized FRBs, and adapted to sources with possibly core-collapse supernova progenitors, to help constrain potential models for the FRB population at large.",astro-ph.HE

Observationally, FRBs can be divided into two classes, repeating FRBs and non-repeating FRBs. At present, twenty repeating FRBs have been discovered with unknown physical origins. Localization of the first repeating FRB 121102 and discovery of an associated persistent radio source support that FRBs are powered by young millisecond magnetars, which could be formed by core-collapses of massive stars or binary neutron stars mergers. These two formation channels can be distinguished by gravitational waves generated by binary neutron stars mergers. We first calculate the lower limit of the local formation rate of repeating FRBs observed by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) . Then we show that only a small fraction ($6\%$) of repeating FRBs is produced by young magnetars from binary neutron star mergers, basing on the gravitational wave detections by the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Therefore, we believe that repeating FRBs are more likely produced by the magnetars newborn from the core-collapses of massive stars rather than the magnetars from the binary neutron stars mergers.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2002.12834,"Fabrice Mottez, Philippe Zarka, Guillaume Voisin, ",Repeating fast radio bursts caused by small bodies orbiting a pulsar or a magnetar,"Asteroids orbiting into the highly magnetized and highly relativistic wind of a pulsar offer a favourable configuration for repeating fast radio bursts (FRB). The body in direct contact with the wind develops a trail formed of a stationary Alfv\'en wave, called an \textit{Alfv\'en wing}. When an element of wind crosses the Alfv\'en wing, it sees a rotation of the ambient magnetic field that can cause radio-wave instabilities. In the observer's reference frame, the waves are collimated in a very narrow range of directions, and they have an extremely high intensity. A previous work, published in 2014, showed that planets orbiting a pulsar can cause FRB when they pass in our line of sight. We predicted periodic FRB. Since then random FRB repeaters have been discovered. We present an upgrade of this theory where repeaters can be explained by the interaction of smaller bodies with a pulsar wind. Considering the properties of relativistic Alfv\'en wings attached to a body in the pulsar wind, and taking thermal consideration into account we conduct a parametric study. We find that FRBs, including the Lorimer burst (30 Jy), can be explained by small size pulsar companions (1 to 10 km) between 0.03 and 1 AU from a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Some sets of parameters are also compatible with a magnetar. Our model is compatible with the high rotation measure of FRB121102. The bunched timing of the FRBs is the consequence of a moderate wind turbulence. As asteroid belt composed of less than 200 bodies would suffice for the FRB occurrence rate measured with FRB121102. This model, after the present upgrade, is compatible with the properties discovered since its first publication in 2014, when repeating FRB were still unknown. It is based on standard physics, and on common astrophysical objects that can be found in any kind of galaxy. It requires $10^{10}$ times less power than (common) isotropic-emission FRB models.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2002.12539,Hyerin Cho et al.,Spectropolarimetric analysis of FRB 181112 at microsecond resolution: Implications for Fast Radio Burst emission mechanism,"We have developed a new coherent dedispersion mode to study the emission of Fast Radio Bursts that trigger the voltage capture capability of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) interferometer. In principle the mode can probe emission timescales down to 3 ns with full polarimetric information preserved. Enabled by the new capability, here we present a spectropolarimetric analysis of FRB 181112 detected by ASKAP, localized to a galaxy at redshift 0.47. At microsecond time resolution the burst is resolved into four narrow pulses with a rise time of just $15 \mu$s for the brightest. The pulses have a diversity of morphology, but do not show evidence for temporal broadening by turbulent plasma along the line of sight, nor is there any evidence for periodicity in their arrival times. The pulses are highly polarized (up to 95%), with the polarization position angle varying both between and within pulses. The pulses have apparent rotation measures that vary by $15\pm 2\, {\rm rad \,m^{-2}}$ and apparent dispersion measures that vary by $0.041\pm 0.004\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Conversion between linear and circular polarization is observed across the brightest pulse. We conclude that the FRB 181112 pulses are most consistent with being a direct manifestation of the emission process or the result of propagation through a relativistic plasma close to the source. This demonstrates that our method, which facilitates high-time-resolution polarimetric observations of FRBs, can be used to study not only burst emission processes, but also a diversity of propagation effects present on the gigaparsec paths they traverse.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2002.12533,Mawson W. Sammons et al.,First Constraints on Compact Dark Matter from Fast Radio Burst Microstructure,"Despite existing constraints, it remains possible that up to $35\%$ of all dark matter is comprised of compact objects, such as the black holes in the 10-100\,M$_\odot$ range whose existence has been confirmed by LIGO. The strong gravitational lensing of transients such as FRBs and GRBs has been suggested as a more sensitive probe for compact dark matter than intensity fluctuations observed in microlensing experiments. Recently ASKAP has reported burst substructure down to $15\mu$s timescales in FRBs in the redshift range $0.3-0.5$. We investigate here the implications of this for the detectability of compact dark matter by FRBs. We find that a sample size of $\sim130$ FRBs would be required to constrain compact dark matter to less than the existing 35$\%$ limit with 95$\%$ confidence, if it were distributed along $\gtrsim 1\,$Gpc-long FRB sightlines through the cosmic web. Conversely, existing constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter permit as many as 1 in $\approx 40$ of all $z \lesssim 0.4$ FRBs to exhibit micro-lensed burst structure. Approximately $170$ FRBs intercepting halos within $\sim 50\,$kpc would be required to exclude the fraction of compact dark matter in each intercepted halo to a similar level. Furthermore, we consider the cumulative effects of lensing of the FRB signal by a macroscopic dark matter distribution. We conclude that lensing from a uniform distribution of compact objects is likely not observable, but suggest that FRBs may set meaningful limits on power-law distributions of dark matter.",astro-ph.CO

The large discrepancy between the FRB and CBC event rate densities suggest their associations, if any, should only apply at most for a small fraction of FRBs. Through a Bayesian estimation method, we show how a statistical analysis of the coincident associations of FRBs with CBC gravitational wave (GW) events may test the hypothesis of these associations. We show that during the operation period of advanced LIGO, the detection of $\sim100$ ($\sim1000$) GW-less FRBs with dispersion measure (DM) values smaller than 500 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ could reach the constraint that less than $10\%$ (or $1\%$) FRBs are related to binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The same number of FRBs with DM values smaller than 100 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ is required to reach the same constraint for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. With the upgrade of GW detectors, the same constraints for BBH and BNS mergers can be reached with less FRBs or looser requirements for the DM values. It is also possible to pose constraints on the fraction of each type of CBCs that are able to produce observable FRBs based on the event density of FRBs and CBCs. This would further constrain the dimensionless charge of black holes in binary BH systems.",astro-ph.HE

By a preliminary calculation, we find that NSWD mergers with unstable mass transfer could result in the NS acquiring an ultra-strong magnetic field via the dynamo mechanism due to differential rotation and convection or possibly via the magnetic flux conservation scenario of a fossil field. If NSWD mergers can indeed create magnetars, then such objects could produce at least a subset of FRB 180924-like FRBs within the framework of flaring magnetars, since the ejecta, local environments, and host galaxies of the final remnants from NSWD mergers resemble those of BNS/BWD/AIC channels.

Until recently, most FRBs have been detected at frequencies greater than 1 GHz with a few exceptions at 800 MHz. The recent discoveries of FRBs at 400 MHz from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope has opened up possibilities for new insights about the progenitors while many other low frequency surveys in the past have failed to find any FRBs. Here, we present results from a FRB survey recently conducted at the Jodrell Bank Observatory at 332 MHz with the 76-m Lovell telescope for a total of 58 days. We did not detect any FRBs in the survey and report a 90$\%$ upper limit of 5500 FRBs per day per sky for a Euclidean Universe above a fluence threshold of 46 Jy ms. We discuss the possibility of absorption as the main cause of non-detections in low frequency (< 800 MHz) searches and invoke different absorption models to explain the same. We find that Induced Compton Scattering alone cannot account for absorption of radio emission and that our simulations favour a combination of Induced Compton Scattering and Free-Free Absorption to explain the non-detections. For a free-free absorption scenario, our constraints on the electron density are consistent with those expected in the post-shock region of the ionized ejecta in Super-Luminous SuperNovae (SLSNe).",astro-ph.HE

In our model, the WD fills its Roche lobe at periastron, and mass transfer occurs from the WD to the NS around this point. The accreted material may be fragmented into a number of parts, which arrive at the NS at different times. The fragmented magnetized material may trigger magnetic reconnection near the NS surface. The electrons can be accelerated to an ultra-relativistic speed, and therefore the curvature radiation of the electrons can account for the burst activity. In this scenario, the duty cycle of burst activity is related to the orbital period of the binary. We show that such a model may work for duty cycles roughly from ten minutes to two days. For the recently reported 16.35-day periodicity of FRB 180916.J0158+65, our model does not naturally explain such a long duty cycle, since an extremely high eccentricity ($e>0.95$) is required.",astro-ph.HE

The eccentricity of the neutron star may be due to rotation or strong magnetic field etc. We found that the 16-day period may be understood using typical masses of the fallback disk.

It is expected that numerous FRBs with identified redshifts will be available in the near future through the identification of their host galaxies or counterparts. $\rm DM_{IGM}$, the contribution from IGM to the observed dispersion measure (DM) of FRB, carries the key information about IGM and the cosmic expansion history. We can thus study the evolution of the universe by using FRBs with identified redshifts. In the present work, we are interested in the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$, which is useful to study the cosmic expansion and the problem of the ""missing baryons"". We propose to reconstruct the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift $z$ with FRBs via a completely model-independent method, namely Gaussian processes.

The FRBs are produced by a highly magnetized pulsar, whose magnetic field is ``combed'' by the strong wind from a companion star, either a massive star or a millisecond pulsar. The FRB pulsar wind retains a clear funnel in the companion's wind that is otherwise opaque to induced Compton or Raman scatterings for repeating FRB emission. The 4 day active window corresponds to the time when the funnel points toward Earth. The interaction also perturbs the magnetosphere of the FRB pulsar and may trigger emission of FRBs. We derive the physical constraints on the comb and the FRB pulsar from the observations and estimate the event rate of FRBs. In this scenario, a lower limit on the period of observable FRBs is predicted. We speculate that both the intrinsic factors (strong magnetic field and young age) and the extrinsic factor (interaction) may be needed to generate FRBs in neutron star binary systems.",astro-ph.HE

In a popular class of models, the fast radio bursts (FRBs) are created by giant magnetic flares of a hyper-active magnetar driven by fast ambipolar diffusion in the core. We point out that in this scenario the magnetar is expected to precess freely with a period of hours to weeks. The internal magnetic field $B\sim 10^{16}$G deforms the star, and magnetic flares induce sudden changes in magnetic stresses. The resulting torques and displacements of the principal axes of inertia are capable of pumping a significant amplitude of precession. The anisotropy of the flaring FRB activity, combined with precession, implies a strong periodic modulation of the visible bursting rate. The ultra-strong field invoked in the magnetar model provides: (1) energy for the frequent giant flares, (2) the high rate of ambipolar diffusion, releasing the magnetic energy on the timescale $\sim 10^9$s, (3) the core temperature $T\approx 10^9$K, likely above the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity, (4) strong magnetospheric torques, which efficiently spin down the star, and (5) deformation with ellipticity $\epsilon> 10^{-6}$, much greater than the rotational deformation.

In this paper, we investigate this channel of magnetar formation in more detail. We propose that the NS-WD post-merger, after cooling and angular momentum redistribution, may collapse to either a black hole or a new NS or even remains as a hybrid WDNS, depending on the total mass of the NS and WD. In particular, the newly formed NS can be a magnetar if the core of the WD collapsed into the NS while large quantities of degenerate electrons of the WD compressed to the outer layers of the new NS. A strong magnetic field can be formed by the electrons and positive charges with different angular velocities induced by the differential rotation of the newborn magnetar. Such a magnetar can power the repeating FRBs by the magnetic reconnections due to the crustal movements or starquakes.",astro-ph.HE

Wang et al.,"Fast radio bursts from activities of neutron stars newborn in BNS mergers: offset, birth rate and observational properties","Young neutron stars (NSs) born in core-collapse explosions are promising candidates for the central engines of fast radio bursts (FRBs), since the first localized repeating burst FRB 121102 happens in a star forming dwarf galaxy, which is similar to the host galaxies of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). However, FRB 180924 and FRB 190523 are localized to massive galaxies with low rates of star formation, compared with the host of FRB 121102. Meanwhile, the offsets between the bursts and host centers are about 4 kpc and 29 kpc for FRB 180924 and FRB 190523, respectively. These properties of hosts are similar to short gamma-ray bursts \textbf{(SGRBs)}, which are produced by mergers of binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH). Therefore, the NSs powering FRBs may be formed in BNS mergers. In this paper, we study the BNS merger rates, merger times, and predict their most likely merger locations for different types of host galaxies using population synthesis method. We find that the BNS merger channel is consistent with the recently reported offsets of FRB 180924 and FRB 190523. The offset distribution of short GRBs is well reproduced by population synthesis using galaxy model which is similar to GRB hosts. The event rate of FRBs (including non-repeating and repeating), is larger than those of BNS merger and short GRBs, which requires a large fraction of observed FRBs emitting several bursts.

Depending on the mass of the companion, the binary period ranges from several hundred to thousands of seconds.

In the case of FRB 180916.J0158+65 the primary is an early OB-type star with mass loss rate $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}- 10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and the secondary a neutron star. The observed periodicity is not intrinsic to the FRB's source, but is due to the orbital phase-dependent modulation of the absorption conditions in the massive star's wind. The observed relatively narrow FRB activity window implies that the primary's wind dynamically dominates that of the pulsar, $\eta = L_{sd}/(\dot{M} v_w c) \leq 1$, where $L_{sd} $ is pulsar spin-down, $\dot{M}$ is the primary's wind mass loss rate and $v_w$ is its velocity. The condition $\eta \leq 1$ requires mildly powerful pulsar with $L_{sd} \lesssim 10^{37}$ erg $s^{-1}$.

arXiv:2002.01570,Dylan L. Jow et al.,Wave effects in the microlensing of pulsars and FRBs by point masses,"Wave effects are often neglected in microlensing studies; however, for coherent point-like sources, such as pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), wave effects will become important in their gravitational lensing. In this paper, we describe the wave optics formalism, its various limits, and the conditions for which these limits hold. Using the simple point lens as an example, we will show that the frequency dependence of wave effects breaks degeneracies that are present in the usual geometric optics limit, and constructive interference results in larger magnifications further from the lens. This latter fact leads to a generic increase in cross section for microlensing events in the wave-optics regime compared to the geometric optics regime. For realistic percent-level spectral sensitivities, this leads to a relative boost in lensing cross section of more than an order of magnitude. We apply the point-lens model to the lensing of FRBs and pulsars and find that these radio sources will be lensed in the full wave-optics regime by isolated masses in the range of $0.1-100\,M_\oplus$, which includes free-floating planets (FFPs), whose Einstein radius is smaller than the Fresnel scale. More generally, the interference pattern allows an instantaneous determination of lens masses, unlike traditional microlensing techniques which only yield a mass inference from the event timescale.",astro-ph.HE

The interferometer allows us to localise the FRB to a narrow $5\arcsec\times7\arcmin$ ellipse by employing both multibeam information within the Apertif phased-array feed (PAF) beam pattern, and across different tied-array beams. The resulting sight line passes close to Local Group galaxy M33, with an impact parameter of only 18\,kpc with respect to the core. It also traverses the much larger circumgalactic medium of M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. We find that the shared plasma of the Local Group galaxies could contribute $\sim$10\% of its dispersion measure of 588\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. FRB\,191108 has a Faraday rotation measure of +474\,$\pm\,3$\,rad\,m$^{-2}$, which is too large to be explained by either the Milky Way or the intergalactic medium. Based on the more moderate RMs of other extragalactic sources that traverse the halo of M33, we conclude that the dense magnetised plasma resides in the host galaxy. The FRB exhibits frequency structure on two scales, one that is consistent with quenched Galactic scintillation and broader spectral structure with $\Delta\nu\approx40$\,MHz. If the latter is due to scattering in the shared M33/M31 CGM, our results constrain the Local Group plasma environment.

The bursting rate for repeaters could be very high and the emission site is likely from a magnetosphere. We discuss a hypothesis of producing abundant repeating FRBs in BNS systems. Decades to centuries before a BNS system coalesces, the magnetospheres of the two neutron stars start to interact relentlessly. Abrupt magnetic reconnection accelerates particles, which emit coherent radio waves in bunches via curvature radiation. FRBs are detected as these bright radiation beams point towards Earth. This model predicts quasi-periodicity of the bursts at the rotation periods of the two merging neutron stars (tens of milliseconds and seconds, respectively) as well as the period of orbital motion (of the order of 100 s). The bursting activities are expected to elevate with time as the two neutron stars get closer. The repeating FRB sources should be gravitational wave (GW) sources for space-borne detectors such as LISA if the sources are close enough, and will be eventually detected by ground-based detectors when the two neutron stars coalesce.",astro-ph.HE

We show that theoretically there should be a simple relation between RM and the luminosity of the persistent source of an FRB source if the observed RM mostly arises from the persistent emission region. FRB 121102 follows this relation given that the magnetic field in the persistent emission region is highly ordered and that the number of relativistic electrons powering the persistent emission is comparable to that of non-relativistic electrons that contribute to RM. The non-detections of persistent emission sources from all other localized FRB sources are consistent with their relatively small RMs ($\left|{\rm RM}\right|\lesssim{\rm a~few}\times100~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$) according to this relation.

arXiv:2001.10758,"Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, ",Fast radio bursts as strong waves interacting with ambient medium,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients whose physical origin is still unknown. Within a few astronomical units near an FRB source, the electric field of the electromagnetic wave is so large that the electron oscillation velocity becomes relativistic, which makes the classical Thomson scattering theory and the linear plasma theory invalid. We discuss FRBs as strong waves interacting with the ambient medium, in terms of both electron motion properties and plasma properties. Several novel features are identified. 1. The cross section of Thomson scattering is significantly enhanced for the scattering photons. 2. On the other hand, because of the nonlinear plasma properties in strong waves, the near-source plasma is more transparent and has a smaller effective dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the observed value. For a repeating FRB source, the brighter bursts would have somewhat smaller DMs contributed by the near-source plasma. 3. The radiation beam undergoes relativistic self-focusing in a dense plasma, the degree of self-focusing (or squeezing) depends on the plasma density. Such a squeezing effect would affect the collimation angle and the true event rate of FRBs. 4. When an FRB propagates in a nearby ambient plasma, a wakefield wave in the plasma will be generated by the ponderomotive force of the FRB and accelerates electrons in the ambient medium.

We suggest that the FRBs are caused by the self-focusing of an electron beam interacting with an ambient plasma right beyond the light cylinder radius of a neutron star. The magnetic field at the light cylinder radius is relatively high which can accommodate both young Crab-like systems and old millisecond pulsars addressing the diverse environments of FRBs. At the first stage, the intense pulsed-beam passing through the background plasma causes instabilities such that the trapped particles in local Buneman-type cavitons saturate the local field. The beam is then radially self-focused due to the circular electric field developed by the two-stream instability which leads to Weibel instability in the transverse direction. Finally, the non-linear saturation of the Weibel instability results in the self-modulational formation of solitons due to plasmoid instability. The resonant solitary waves are the breather-type solitons hosting relativistic particles with self-excited oscillations. The analytical solutions obtained for non-linear dispersion and solitons suggest that, near the current sheets, the relativistic bunches are accelerated/amplified by klystron-like structures due to self-excited oscillations by the induced local electric field. Boosted coherent radio emission propagates through a narrow cone with strong focusing due to radial electric field and magnetic pinching. The non-linear evolution of solitons and the stimulated emission are associated with the Buneman instability and the possibility of the presence of nanosecond shots in FRBs are investigated.",astro-ph.HE

Second, for astrophysically relevant plasmas of pulsar magnetospheres, (and possible loci of Fast Radio Bursts), where cyclotron frequency $\omega_B$ dominates over plasma frequency $\omega_p$ and the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, $\omega_B \gg \omega_p,\, \omega$, we show that (i) there is virtually no nonlinearity due to changing effective mass in the field of the wave; (ii) ponderomotive force is $F_p^{(B)} =- {m_e c^2}/({4 B_0^2}) \nabla E^2$; it is reduced by a factor $(\omega/\omega_B)^2$ if compared to the unmagnetized case ($B_0$ is the external magnetic field and $E$ is the electric field of the wave); (iii) for radiation beam propagating along constant magnetic field in pair plasma with density $n_\pm$, the ponderomotive force leads to appearance of circular currents that lead to the decrease of the field within the beam by a factor $\Delta B/B_0 = 2\pi n_\pm m_e c^2 {E^2}/{B_0^4}$.

A prediction of this scenario is that compact radio sources offset from the centers of dwarf galaxies may serve as signposts for at least some FRBs. Recently, Reines et al. 2019 presented the discovery of 20 such radio sources in nearby ($z\lesssim 0.055$) dwarf galaxies, and argued that these cannot be explained by emission from HII regions, normal supernova remnants, or normal radio supernovae. Instead, they attribute the emission to accreting wandering massive black holes. Here, we explore the alternative possibility that these sources are analogs of FRB 121102.

Though over a hundred FRB sources have been discovered to date, only four have been localised and associated with a host galaxy, with just one of the four known to repeat. The properties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, provide important clues about their physical origins. However, the first known repeating FRB has been localised to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy, and the apparently non-repeating sources to higher-metallicity, massive elliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and apparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins.

This type of delay is frequency-dependent and is usually used for estimating the projected number density of electrons along the line of sight, called the dispersion measure. The dense and clumpy distribution of plasma can cause refractive deflections of radio signals, analogous to lensing effects. Similar to gravitational lensing, there are two contributions to the time delay effect in plasma lensing: a geometric delay, due to increased path length of the signal, and a dispersive delay due to the change of speed of light in a plasma medium. We show the delay time for two models of the plasma distribution, and point out that the estimated dispersion measure can be biased. Since the contribution of the geometric effect can be comparable to that of the dispersive delay, the bias in the measured dispersion measure can be dramatically large if plasma lensing effects are not taken into account when signals propagate through a high-density gradient clump of plasma.",astro-ph.HE

At the onset of the magnetar flare, a large scale magnetic perturbation forms a magnetic pulse, which propagates from the flare cite outwards. The pulse strongly compresses magnetospheric plasma and pushes it away. The high-frequency MHD waves are generated when the magnetic pulse reaches the current sheet separating, just beyond the light cylinder, the oppositely directed magnetic fields. Coalescence of magnetic islands in the reconnecting current sheet produces magnetosonic waves, which propagate away on the top of the magnetic pulse and escape in the far zone of the wind as radio waves polarized along the rotational axis of the magnetar.

The dispersion measure and rotation measure should therefore vary slightly from burst to burst for a repeating source, depending on the luminosity and frequency of the individual burst. Furthermore, free-free absorption of strong waves is suppressed due to the accelerated electrons' reduced energy exchange in Coulomb collisions. This allows bright low-frequency bursts to propagate through an environment that would be optically thick to low-amplitude waves. Given a large sample of bursts from a repeating source, it would be possible to use the deficit of low-frequency and low-luminosity bursts to infer the emission measure of the local intervening plasma and its distance from the source.

A single power-law might not fit the R1 burst energy distribution across the full energy range or widely separated detections. Our observations provide improved constraints on the clustering of R1 bursts. Our stringent upper limits on the linear polarisation fraction imply a significant depolarisation, either intrinsic to the emission mechanism or caused by the intervening medium, at 1400 MHz that is not observed at higher frequencies.

Determining the redshift distribution of FRB's appears to require arcsecond angular resolution, in order to associate FRB's with host galaxies. In this paper, we forecast prospects for determining the redshift distribution without host galaxy associations, by cross-correlating FRB's with a galaxy catalog such as the SDSS photometric sample. The forecasts are extremely promising: a survey such as CHIME/FRB that measures catalogs of $\sim 10^3$ FRB's with few-arcminute angular resolution can place strong constraints on the FRB redshift distribution, by measuring the cross-correlation as a function of galaxy redshift $z$ and FRB dispersion measure $D$. In addition, propagation effects from free electron inhomogeneities modulate the observed FRB number density, either by shifting FRB's between dispersion measure (DM) bins or through DM-dependent selection effects. We show that these propagation effects, coupled with the spatial clustering between galaxies and free electrons, can produce FRB-galaxy correlations which are comparable to the intrinsic clustering signal.

Although the first FRB was detected more than a decade ago, the progenitors of these energetic events are not yet known. The currently preferred formation channel involves the formation of a neutron star (NS)/magnetar. While these objects are often the end product of the core-collapse (CC) explosion of massive stars, they could also be the outcome of the merging of two massive white dwarfs. In the merger scenario the ejected material interacts with a constant-density circumbinary medium and creates supersonic shocks. We found that when a radio pulse passes through these shocks the dispersion measure (DM) increases with time during the free expansion phase. The rotation measure (RM) displays a similar trend if the power-law index, $n$, of the outer part of the ejecta is $>6$. For $n = 6$ the RM remains constant during this phase. Later, when the ejecta move into the Sedov-Taylor phase while the DM still increases, however, with a different rate, the RM reduces. This behaviour is somewhat similar to that of FRB 121102 for which a marginal increase of DM and a 10% decrease of RM have been observed over time. These features are in contrast to the CC scenario, where the DM and RM contributions to the radio signal always diminish with time.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1912.07847,C. W. James et al.,Which bright fast radio bursts repeat?,"A handful of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are now known to repeat. However, the question remains --- do they all? We report on an extensive observational campaign with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Parkes, and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, searching for repeat bursts from FRBs detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey. In 383.2 hr of follow-up observations covering 27 FRBs initially detected as single bursts, only two repeat bursts from a single FRB, FRB 171019, were detected, which have been previously reported by Kumar et al. We use simulations of repeating FRBs that allow for clustering in burst arrival times to calculate new estimates for the repetition rate of FRB 171019, finding only slight evidence for incompatibility with the properties of FRB 121102. Our lack of repeat bursts from the remaining FRBs set limits on the model of all bursts being attributable to repeating FRBs. Assuming a reasonable range of repetition behaviour, at most 60% (90% C.L.) of these FRBs having an intrinsic burst distribution similar to FRB~121102. This result is shown to be robust against different assumptions on the nature of repeating FRB behaviour, and indicates that if indeed all FRBs repeat, the majority must do so very rarely.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1912.07620,Andrey Katz et al.,Looking for MACHOs in the Spectra of Fast Radio Bursts,"We explore a novel search strategy for dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) such as primordial black holes or dense mini-halos in the mass range from $10^{-4}$ to 0.1 solar masses. These objects can gravitationally lens the signal of fast radio bursts (FRBs), producing a characteristic interference pattern in the frequency spectrum, similar to the previously studied femtolensing signal in gamma ray burst spectra. Unlike traditional searches using microlensing, FRB lensing will probe the abundance of MACHOs at cosmological distance scales (~Gpc) rather than just their distribution in the neighborhood of the Milky Way. The method is thus particularly relevant for dark mini-halos, which may be inaccessible to microlensing due to their finite spatial extent or tidal disruption in galaxies. We find that the main complication in FRB lensing will be interstellar scintillation in the FRB's host galaxy and in the Milky Way. Scintillation is difficult to quantify because it heavily depends on turbulence in the interstellar medium, which is poorly understood. We show that, nevertheless, for realistic scintillation parameters, FRB lensing can set competitive limits on compact dark matter object, and we back our findings with explicit simulations.",astro-ph.CO

We perform a detailed analysis of the double neutron star (DNS) population, accounting for radio survey selection effects. The surface magnetic field decay timescale (${\sim}1000$\,Myr) and mass scale (${\sim}0.02$\,M$_\odot$) are the dominant uncertainties in our model. Mass accretion during common envelope evolution plays a non-trivial role in recycling pulsars. We find a best-fit model that is in broad agreement with the observed Galactic DNS population. Though the pulsar parameters (period and period derivative) are strongly biased by radio selection effects, the observed orbital parameters (orbital period and eccentricity) closely represent the intrinsic distributions. The number of radio observable DNSs in the Milky Way at present is about 2500 in our model, corresponding to approximately 10\% of the predicted total number of DNSs in the galaxy. Using our model calibrated to the Galactic DNS population, we make predictions for DNS mergers observed in gravitational waves. The DNS chirp mass distribution varies from 1.1M$_\odot$ to 2.1M$_\odot$ and the median is found to be 1.14\,M$_\mathrm{\odot}$. The expected effective spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ for isolated DNSs is $\lesssim$0.03 from our model. We predict that 34\% of the current Galactic isolated DNSs will merge within a Hubble time, and have a median total mass of 2.7\,M$_\mathrm{\odot}$.

Its medium is a stratified structure produced by a progenitor wind.

FRBs are likely to originate from distant neutron stars, but our knowledge of the radio pulsar population has been limited to the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. In an attempt to increase our understanding of extragalactic pulsar populations, and its giant-pulse emission, we employed the low-frequency radio telescope LOFAR to search the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) for radio bursts emitted by young, Crab-like pulsars. For direct comparison we also present a LOFAR study on the low-frequency giant pulses from the Crab pulsar; their fluence distribution follows a power law with slope 3.04(3). A number of candidate signals were detected from M31 but none proved persistent. FRBs are sometimes thought of as Crab-like pulsars with exceedingly bright giant pulses -- given our sensitivity, we can rule out that M31 hosts pulsars more than an order of magnitude brighter than the Crab pulsar, assuming their pulse scattering follows that of the known FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

These sources have low excess dispersion measures (DMs) ($ < 100 \rm \, pc \, cm^{-3}$ and $ < 20 \rm \, pc \, cm^{-3}$, respectively), implying relatively small maximal distances. They were repeatedly observed by AGILE in the MeV--GeV energy range. We do not detect prompt emission simultaneously with these repeating events. This search is particularly significant for the submillisecond and millisecond integrations obtainable by AGILE. The sources are constrained to emit a MeV-fluence in the millisecond range below $F'_{MeV} = 10^{-8} \, \rm erg \, cm^{-2}$ corresponding to an isotropic energy near $E_{MeV,UL} \simeq 2 \times 10^{46}\,$erg for a distance of 150 Mpc (applicable to Source 1). We also searched for $\gamma$-ray emission for time intervals up to 100 days, obtaining 3$\,\sigma$ upper limits (ULs) for the average isotropic luminosity above 50 MeV, $L_{\gamma,UL} \simeq \,$(5-10)$\,\times 10^{43} \rm \, erg \, s^{-1}$.

Our results are significant in constraining the high-energy emission of underlying sources such as magnetars, or other phenomena related to extragalactic compact objects, and show the prompt emission to be lower than the peak of the 2004 magnetar outburst of SGR 1806-20 for source distances less than about 100 Mpc.",astro-ph.HE

Shanahan et al.,Strong excess Faraday rotation on the Inside of the Sagittarius spiral arm,"We present first results for Faraday rotation of compact polarized sources (1 to 2 GHz continuum) in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey of the inner Galaxy. In the Galactic longitude range 39 degr < l < 52 degr, we find rotation measures in the range -310 rad/m2 < RM < +4219 rad/m2, with the highest values concentrated within a degree of l = 48 degrees at the Sagittarius arm tangent. Most of the high RMs arise in diffuse plasma, along lines of sight that do not intersect HII regions. For l > 49 degr, RM drops off rapidly, while at l < 47 degr, the mean RM is higher with a larger standard deviation than at l > 49 degr. We attribute the RM structure to the compressed diffuse Warm Ionized Medium in the spiral arm, upstream of the major star formation regions. The Sagittarius arm acts as a significant Faraday screen inside the Galaxy. This has implications for models of the Galactic magnetic field and the expected amount of Faraday rotation of Fast Radio Bursts from their host galaxies. We emphasize the importance of sensitivity to high Faraday depth in future polarization surveys.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:1911.05765,"Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger, Lorenzo Sironi, ",Constraints on the Engines of Fast Radio Bursts,"We model the sample of fast radio bursts (FRB), including the newly discovered CHIME repeaters, using the synchrotron blast wave model of Metzger, Margalit & Sironi (2019). This model postulates that FRBs are precursor radiation from ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks generated as flare ejecta from a central engine collide with an effectively stationary external medium. Downward drifting of the burst frequency structure naturally arises from deceleration of the blast-wave. The data are consistent with FRBs being produced by flares of energy $E_{\rm flare} \sim 10^{43}-10^{46}(f_{\xi}/10^{-3})^{-4/5}$ erg, where $f_{\xi}$ is the maser efficiency, and minimum bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma \approx 10^2-10^3$, which generate the observed FRBs at shock radii $r_{\rm sh} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ cm. We infer upstream densities $n_{\rm ext}(r_{\rm sh}) \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and radial profiles $n_{\rm ext} \propto r^{-k}$ showing a range of slopes $k \approx [-2,1]$ (which are seen to evolve between bursts), broadly consistent with the upstream medium being the inner edge of an ion-loaded shell released by a recent energetic flare. The burst timescales, energetics, rates, and external medium properties are consistent with repeating FRBs arising from young, hyper-active flaring magnetars, but the methodology presented is generally applicable to any central engine which injects energy impulsively into a dense magnetized medium. Uncertainties and variations of the model are discussed, including the effects of the strong electric field of the FRB wave (strength parameter $a \gg 1$) on the upstream medium. One-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized shocks into a pair plasma are presented which demonstrate that high maser efficiency can be preserved, even in the limit $a \gg 1$ in which the FRB wave accelerates the upstream electrons to ultra-relativistic speeds.",astro-ph.HE

This evolution is coupled with that of the stellar rotation $\Omega$, and depends on the competing effects of internal viscous dissipation and external torques. We study this coupled evolution for a model magnetar with a strong internal toroidal field, extending previous work by modelling -- for the first time in this context -- the strong proto-magnetar wind acting shortly after birth. We also account for the effect of buoyancy forces on viscous dissipation at late times. Typically we find that $\chi\to 90^\circ$ shortly after birth, then decreases towards $0^\circ$ over hundreds of years. From observational indications that magnetars typically have small $\chi$, we infer that these stars are subject to a stronger average exterior torque than radio pulsars, and that they were born spinning faster than $\sim 100-300$ Hz. Our results allow us to make quantitative predictions for the gravitational and electromagnetic signals from a newborn rotating magnetar.

arXiv:1910.14058,Fabian R. N. Schneider et al.,How mergers magnetise massive stars,"Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The Sun's magnetic field drives the solar wind and causes solar flares and other energetic surface phenomena that profoundly affect space weather here on Earth. The first magnetic field in a star other than the Sun was detected in 1947 in the peculiar A-type star 78 Vir. It is now known that the magnetic fields of the Sun and other low-mass stars (<1.5 solar masses) are generated in-situ by a dynamo process in their turbulent, convective envelopes. Unlike such stars, intermediate-mass and high-mass stars (>1.5 solar masses; referred to as ""massive"" stars here) have relatively quiet, radiative envelopes where a solar-like dynamo cannot operate. However, about 10% of them, including 78 Vir, have strong, large-scale surface magnetic fields whose origin has remained a major mystery. The massive star $\tau$ Sco is a prominent member of this group and appears to be surprisingly young compared to other presumably coeval members of the Upper Scorpius association. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive main-sequence stars and 1D stellar evolution computations of the subsequent evolution of the merger product that can explain $\tau$ Sco's magnetic field, apparent youth and other observed characteristics. We argue that field amplification in stellar mergers is a general mechanism to form strongly-magnetised massive stars. These stars are promising progenitors of those neutron stars that host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe, so-called magnetars, and that may give rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts. Strong magnetic fields affect the explosions of core-collapse supernovae and, moreover, those magnetic stars that have rapidly-rotating cores at the end of their lives might provide the right conditions to power long-duration gamma-ray bursts and super-luminous supernovae.",astro-ph.SR

Naturally, we are curious as to their nature. Enough FRBs have been detected for a statistical approach to parts of this challenge to be feasible. To understand the crucial link between detected FRBs and the underlying FRB source classes we perform FRB population synthesis, to determine how the underlying population behaves. The Python package we developed for this synthesis, frbpoppy, is open source and freely available. Our goal is to determine the current best fit FRB population model. Our secondary aim is to provide an easy-to-use tool for simulating and understanding FRB detections. It can compare surveys, or inform us of the intrinsic FRB population. frbpoppy simulates intrinsic FRB populations and the surveys that find them, to produce virtual observed populations. These resulting populations can then be compared with real data, allowing constrains to be placed on underlying physics and selection effects. We are able to replicate real Parkes and ASKAP FRB surveys, in terms of both detection rates and distributions observed. We also show the effect of beam patterns on the observed dispersion measure (DM) distributions. We compare four types of source models.

Data has to be searched through to detect new and interesting events, often in real-time. These requirements necessitate new and fast algorithms which must process data quickly and accurately.

Our lossy algorithms use an incomplete set of boxcar filters to accelerate detection at the expense of a small reduction in detected signal power.

Motivated by the power-law fluence distributions of FRB 121102, we propose an elementary model for the FRB luminosity function of individual repeaters with an inversion protocol which directly relates the power-law distribution index of magnetar short burst fluences to that for FRBs. The protocol indicates the FRB energy scales virtually linearly with crust/field dislocation amplitude, if magnetar short bursts prevail in the magnetoelastic regime. Charge starvation in the magnetosphere during bursts (required in WT19) for individual repeaters implies the predicted burst fluence distribution is narrow, $\lesssim 3$ decades for yielding strains and oscillation frequencies feasible in magnetar crusts. Requiring magnetic confinement and charge starvation, we obtain a death line for FRBs which segregates magnetars from the normal pulsar population, suggesting only the former will host recurrent FRBs. We convolve the burst energy distribution for individual magnetars to define the distribution of luminosities in evolved magnetar populations. The broken power-law luminosity function's low energy character depends on the population model, while the high energy index traces that of individual repeaters. Independent of the evolved population, the broken power-law isotropic-equivalent energy/luminosity function peaks at $\sim10^{37}-10^{40}$ erg with a low-energy cutoff at $\sim 10^{37}$ erg. Lastly, we consider the local fluence distribution of FRBs, and find that it can constrain the subset of FRB-producing magnetar progenitors. Our model suggests that improvements in sensitivity may reveal flattening of the global FRB fluence distribution and saturation in FRB rates.",astro-ph.HE

Low frequency ($\sim 100$\,MHz) radio telescopes are ideally suited for rapid-response follow-up of transients due to their large field of view, the inverted spectrum of coherent emission, and the fact that the dispersion delay between a 1GHz and 100MHz pulse is on the order of $1-10$\,min for dispersion measures of $100-2000$\,pc/cm$^3$. The MWA has previously been used to provide fast follow up for transient events including gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves, using systems that respond to gamma-ray coordinates network (GCN) packet-based notifications. We describe a system for automatically triggering MWA observations of such events, based on VOEvent triggers, which is more flexible, capable, and accurate than previous systems. The system can respond to external multi-messenger triggers, which makes it well-suited to searching for prompt coherent radio emission from gamma-ray bursts, the study of fast radio bursts and gravitational waves, single pulse studies of pulsars, and rapid follow-up of high-energy superflares from flare stars. The new triggering system has the capability to trigger observations in both the regular correlator mode (limited to $\geq 0.5$\,s integrations) or using the Voltage Capture System (VCS, $0.1$\,ms integration) of the MWA, and represents a new mode of operation for the MWA.

We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe ten SLSN-I more than 5 years old at a frequency of 3 GHz. We searched fast-sampled visibilities for FRBs and used the same data to perform a deep imaging search for late-time radio emission expected in models of magnetar-powered supernovae. No FRBs were found. One SLSN-I, PTF10hgi, is detected in deep imaging, corresponding to a luminosity of $1.2\times10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This luminosity, considered with the recent 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi in Eftekhari et al (2019), supports the interpretation that it is powered by a young, fast-spinning ($\sim$ ms spin period) magnetar with $\sim$ 15 Msun of partially ionized ejecta. Broadly, our observations are most consistent with SLSNe-I being powered by neutron stars with fast spin periods, although most require more free-free absorption than is inferred for PTF10hgi. We predict that radio observations at higher frequencies or in the near future will detect these systems and begin constraining properties of the young pulsars and their birth environments.",astro-ph.HE

A model of binary neutron star merger is proposed for FRB 171019, in which the first bright burst occurred during the merger event, while the subsequent repeating bursts are starquake-induced, and generally fainter, as the energy release rate for the starquakes can hardly exceed that of the catastrophic merger event.

We assume that an emission patch propagates along the dipolar magnetic field lines producing coherent emission with frequency, direction and polarization defined by the local magnetic field. The observed temporal evolution of the frequency depends on relativistic effects of time contraction and the curvature of the magnetic field lines. The model generically produces linear scaling of the drift rate, $\dot{\omega} \propto - \omega$, matching both numerically and parametrically the rates observed in FBRs; a more complicated behavior of $\dot{\omega} $ is also possible. Fast rotating magnetospheres produce higher drifts rates for similar viewing parameters than the slowly rotating ones. In the case of repeaters same source may show variable drift pattens depending on the observing phase. We expect rotational of polarization position angle through a burst, though by smaller amount than in radio pulsars.

In this letter, we propose that if the BBH merger happens in a gaseous disk around a supermassive black hole, the merger can be accompanied by a transient radio flare alike a fast radio burst (FRB). We argue that the total mass and the effective spin derived from GW detection can be used to distinguish such a source from other channels of BBH mergers. If the prediction is confirmed with future observation, multi-messenger astronomy can be brought to a distance which is one order of magnitude farther than present. The mystery of the origin of FRBs can also be revealed partially.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1909.07626,Shangyu Sun et al.,A search for short-term hard X-ray bursts in the direction of the repeating FRB 121102,"The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), which occurs on millisecond time scales in the radio band, has not been well-understood. Among their unknown observational properties are their broadband spectra and persistent and transient multi-wavelength counterparts. Well-localized FRBs provide us the opportunity to address these issues in archival observations. We have performed searches for 15-150 keV hard X-ray bursts on time scales as short as millisecond in the direction of the repeating FRB 121102 (with a spacial resolution of a few arcminutes) in the archival Swift/BAT data during the period between October 2016 and September 2017. We have found no significant (5 $\sigma$) hard X-ray bursts in the direction of the repeating FRB. We have derived an upper limit of the hard X-ray (15--150 keV) flux of any X-ray bursts on 1 ms time scale of around $1.01 \times 10^{-7}$erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, if assuming a photo-index of 2 for potential X-ray flares in X-ray band. A plausible scenario for the repeating FRB as being associated with \emph{magnetar giant flare} is still far below the upper limit.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1909.07165,R. Martone et al.,A cumulative search for hard X/$Î³$-Ray emission associated with fast radio bursts in Fermi/GBM data,"Context. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-long bursts uniquely detected at radio frequencies. FRB 131104 is the only case for which a $\gamma$-ray transient positionally and temporally consistent was claimed. This high-energy transient had a duration of $\sim400$~s and a 15-150~keV fluence $S_{\gamma}\sim4\times10^{-6}$ erg $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. However, the association with the FRB is still debated. Aims. We aim at testing the systematic presence of an associated transient high-energy counterpart throughout a sample of the FRB population. Methods. We used an approach like that used in machine learning methodologies to accurately model the highly-variable Fermi/GBM instrumental background on a time interval comparable to the duration of the proposed $\gamma$-ray counterpart of FRB 131104. A possible $\gamma$-ray signal is then constrained considering sample average lightcurves. Results. We constrain the fluence of the possible $\gamma$-ray signal in the 8-1000 keV band down to $6.4 \times 10^{-7}$ ($7.1 \times 10^{-8}$) erg cm$^{-2}$ for a 200-s (1-s) integration time. Furthermore, we found the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio to be $\eta>10^{8}$ Jy ms erg$^{-1}$ cm$^2$. Conclusions. Our fluence limits exclude $\sim 94\%$ of Fermi/GBM detected long gamma-ray bursts and $\sim 96\%$ of Fermi/GBM detected short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, our limits on the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio point to a different emission mechanism from that of magnetar giant flares. Finally, we exclude a $\gamma$-ray counterpart as fluent as the one possibly associated with FRB 131104 to be a common feature of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1909.05779,Devansh Agarwal et al.,A fast radio burst in the direction of the Virgo cluster,"The rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the direction of nearby galaxy clusters is expected to be higher than the mean cosmological rate if intrinsically faint FRBs are numerous. In this paper, we describe a targeted search for faint FRBs near the core of the Virgo cluster using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder telescope. During 300 hr of observations, we discovered one burst, FRB 180417, with dispersion measure DM $=474.8$ cm$^{-3}$pc. The FRB was promptly followed up by several radio telescopes for 27 h, but no repeat bursts were detected. An optical follow-up of FRB 180417 using the PROMPT5 telescope revealed no new sources down to an $R$-band magnitude of 20.1. We argue that FRB 180417 is likely behind the Virgo cluster as the Galactic and intracluster DM contribution are small compared to the DM of the FRB, and there are no galaxies in the line of sight. The non-detection of FRBs from Virgo constrains the faint-end slope, $\alpha<1.52$ (at 68\% confidence limit), and the minimum luminosity, $L_{\rm min}\gtrsim 2\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 68\% confidence limit), of the FRB luminosity function assuming cosmic FRB rate of $10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ with flux above 1 Jy located out to redshift of 1. Further FRB surveys of galaxy clusters with high-sensitivity instruments will tighten the constraints on the faint end of the luminosity function and, thus, are strongly encouraged.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1909.04632,"Job Feldbrugge, Ue-Li Pen, Neil Turok, ",Oscillatory path integrals for radio astronomy,"We introduce a new method for evaluating the oscillatory integrals which describe natural interference patterns. As an illustrative example of contemporary interest, we consider astrophysical plasma lensing of coherent sources like pulsars and fast radio bursts in radioastronomy. Plasma lenses are known to occur near the source, in the interstellar medium, as well as in the solar wind and the earth's ionosphere. Such lensing is strongest at long wavelengths hence it is generally important to go beyond geometric optics and into the full wave optics regime. Our computational method is a spinoff of new techniques two of us, and our collaborators, have developed for defining and performing Lorentzian path integrals. Cauchy's theorem allows one to transform a computationally fragile and expensive, highly oscillatory integral into an exactly equivalent sum of absolutely and rapidly convergent integrals which can be evaluated in polynomial time. We require only that it is possible to analytically continue the lensing phase, expressed in the integrated coordinates, into the complex domain. We give a first-principles derivation of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral, starting from Feynman's path integral for a massless particle in a refractive medium. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing the interference patterns of Thom's caustic catastrophes, both in their ""normal forms"" and within a variety of more realistic, local lens models, over all wavelengths. Our numerical method, implemented in a freely downloadable code, provides a fast, accurate tool for modeling interference patterns in radioastronomy and other fields of physics.",astro-ph.HE

In practice, however, the effectiveness of this approach depends on a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the intrinsic scatter in the data caused by intervening matter inhomogeneities. Here, we simulate a number of catalogues of mock FRB observations, and use MCMC techniques to forecast constraints, and assess which parameters will likely be best constrained. In all cases we find that any potential improvement in cosmological constraints are limited by the current uncertainty on the the diffuse gas fraction, $f_{\rm d}(z)$. Instead, we find that the precision of current cosmological constraints allows one to constrain $f_{\rm d}(z)$, and possibly its redshift evolution. Combining CMB + BAO + SNe + $H_0$ constraints with just 100 FRBs (with redshifts), we find a typical constraint on the mean diffuse gas fraction of a few percent. A detection of this nature would alleviate the ""missing baryon problem"", and therefore highlights the value of localisation and spectroscopic followup of future FRB detections.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1909.01612,Q. W. Song et al.,The Integrated Pulse Profiles of Fast Radio Bursts,Multi-peaked features appear on the integrated pulse profiles of fast radio burst observed below 2.5 GHz and the instantaneous spectrum of many bursts observed between 4 and 8 GHz. The mechanism of pulse or spectrum shaping has attracted little attention. Here we show that these interference-like pulse profiles are mostly the instantaneous spectra near the source regions of fast radio bursts. The corresponding instantaneous spectra are coincident to the spectrum from a single electron passing through a tapered undulator. The multi-peaked spectrum observed between 4 and 8 GHz can also be explained consistently by this type of spectrum. The spectrum is invisible unless the particles in the radiation beam are bunched. The bunching effect is probably due to the acceleration of particles in the plasma wakefield.,astro-ph.HE

In addition to the spherical component of isothermal gas ($kT\sim0.3$ keV) in hydrostatic equilibrium with the Galactic gravitational potential, our model includes a disk-like non-spherical hot gas component to reproduce the directional dependence of the observed X-ray emission measure (EM). The total gas mass ($1.2\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) is dominated by the spherical component, and is consistent with the total baryon mass of the MW expected from the dark matter mass and the cosmic baryon-to-dark-matter ratio. Our model predicts a mean halo DM of $43\:\,{\rm pc\:cm^{-3}}$, with a full range of $30$-$245\:\,{\rm pc\:cm^{-3}}$ over the whole sky. The large scatter seen in the X-ray EM data implies a $\sim0.2$ dex (rms) fluctuation of the MW halo DM.

arXiv:1909.00494,"Shu-Qing Zhong, Zi-Gao Dai, Can-Min Deng, ",Electromagnetic Emission post Spinning Black Hole-Magnetized Neutron Star Mergers,"For a binary composed of a spinning black hole (BH) (with mass $\gtrsim 7M_\odot$) and a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) (with surface magnetic field strength $B_{\rm S,NS}\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G and mass $\sim 1.4M_\odot$), the NS as a whole will possibly eventually plunge into the BH. During the inspiral phase, the spinning BH could be charged to the Wald charge quantity $Q_{\rm W}$ until merger in an electro-vacuum approximation. During the merger, if the spinning charged BH creates its own magnetosphere due to an electric field strong enough for pair cascades to spark, the charged BH would transit from electro-vacuum to force-free cases and could discharge in a time $\gtrsim1~{\rm ms}$. As the force-free magnetosphere is full of a highly conducting plasma, the magnetic flux over the NS's caps would be retained outside the BH's event horizon under the frozen-in condition. Based on this scenario, we here investigate three possible energy-dissipation mechanisms that could produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in a time interval of the BH's discharge post a BH-NS merger-induced gravitational wave event: (1) magnetic reconnection at the BH's poles would occur, leading to a millisecond bright EM signal, (2) a magnetic shock in the zone of closed magnetic field lines due to the detachment and reconnection of the entire BH magnetic field would probably produce a bright radio emission, e.g., a fast radio burst, and (3) the Blandford-Znajek mechanism would extract the BH's rotational energy, giving rise to a millisecond-duration luminous high-energy burst. We also calculate the luminosities due to these mechanisms as a function of BH's spin for different values of $B_{\rm S,NS}$.",astro-ph.HE

MuÃ±oz, Vikram Ravi, Abraham Loeb, ",Periodic Fast Radio Bursts from Young Neutron Stars,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic radio pulses from cosmological origins. Despite an abundance of detections, their nature remains elusive. At least a subset of FRBs is expected to repeat, as the daily FRB rate surpasses that of any known cataclysmic event, which has been confirmed by observations. One of the proposed mechanisms to generate repeating FRBs is supergiant pulses from young and highly spinning NSs, in which case FRBs could inherit the periodicity of their parent NS. Here we examine the consequences of such a population of periodic fast radio bursts (PFRBs). We calculate the rate and lifetime of PFRB progenitors, and find that each newly born highly spinning NS has to emit a number $N_{\rm PFRB}\sim 10^2$ of bursts during its active lifetime of $\tau\sim 100$ years, after which it becomes too dim and crosses a PFRB ""death line"" analogous to the pulsar one. We propose several tests of this hypothesis. First, the period of PFRBs would increase over time, and their luminosity would decrease, due to the NS spin-down. Second, PFRBs may show modest amounts of rotation measure, given the lack of expelled matter from the pulsar, as opposed to the magnetar-sourced FRBs proposed to explain the first repeater FRB 121102. As an example, we study whether the second confirmed repeater (FRB 180814) is a PFRB, given the preference for an inter-pulse separation of 13 ms within its sub-bursts. We show that, if confirmed, this period would place FRB 180814 in a different category as FRB 121102. We develop tests that would identify---and characterize---the prospective population of PFRBs.",astro-ph.HE

A calculation of the expected reduction in response time by triggering on `negative latency' alerts from aLIGO/Virgo observations of gravitational waves generated by the BNS inspiral is presented. This allows for observations up to 300 MHz where the radio signal is expected to be stronger. To compensate for the poor positional accuracy expected from these alerts, we propose a new MWA observational mode that is capable of viewing one quarter of the sky. We show the sensitivity of this mode is sufficient to detect an FRB-like burst from an event similar to GW170817 if it occurred during the ongoing aLIGO/Virgo third science run (O3).",astro-ph.HE

Besides winds powered by rotation they generate frequent magnetic flares, which launch powerful blast waves into the wind. These internal shocks act as masers producing fast (millisecond) radio bursts (FRBs) with the following properties. (1) GHz radio emission occurs at radii $r\sim 10^{14}$ cm and lasts $\lesssim 1$ ms in observer's time. (2) Induced scattering in the surrounding wind does not suppress the radio burst. (3) The emission has linear polarization set by the magnetar rotation axis. (4) The emission drifts to lower frequencies during the burst, and its duration broadens at lower frequencies. (5) Blast waves in inhomogeneous winds may emit variable bursts; periodicity might appear on sub-ms timescales if the magnetar rotates with $\sim 1$ s period. However, the observed FRB structure is likely changed by lensing effects during propagation through the host galaxy. (6) The FRBs from magnetars are expected to repeat, with rare strong bursts (up to $\sim 10^{43}$ erg) or more frequent weak bursts. (7) When a repeating flare strikes the wind bubble in the tail of a previous flare, the FRB turns into a bright optical flash. Its luminosity may approach that of a supernova Ia and last seconds. The rate of these optical flashes in the universe is much lower than the FRB rate, however it may exceed the supernova rate. Locations of hyper-active magnetars in their host galaxies depend on how they form: magnetars created in supernovae explosions will trace star formation regions, and magnetars formed in mergers of compact objects will be offset. The merger magnetars are expected to be most energetic and particularly hyper-active.",astro-ph.HE

The DM distribution of our repeater sample is statistically indistinguishable from that of the first 12 CHIME/FRB sources that have not repeated. We find, with 4$\sigma$ significance, that repeater bursts are generally wider than those of CHIME/FRB bursts that have not repeated, suggesting different emission mechanisms. Our repeater events show complex morphologies that are reminiscent of the first two discovered repeating FRBs.

We report an upper limit on the rate of fast radio bursts above a fluence of 0.36~Jy ms to be 1.3 $\times$ 10$^6$ events per day per sky. Using population simulations, we show that the FLAG will find a factor of 2--3 more pulsars in same survey duration compared to its single pixel counterpart at the Green Bank Telescope. We also demonstrate that the new phased array receiver, ALPACA for the Arecibo telescope, will be a superior survey instrument and will find pulsars at a higher rate than most contemporary receivers by a factor of 2--10.",astro-ph.HE

Observing and data analysis systems, discovery of a mysterious peryton","We present our piggyback search for fast radio bursts using the Nanshan 26m Radio Telescope and the Kunming 40m Radio Telescope. The observations are performed in the L-band from 1380 MHz to 1700 MHz at Nanshan and S-band from 2170 MHz to 2310 MHz at Kunming. We built the \textsc{Roach2}-based FFT spectrometer and developed the real-time transient search software. We introduce a new radio interference mitigation technique named \emph{zero-DM matched filter} and give the formula of the signal-to-noise ratio loss in the transient search. Though we have no positive detection of bursts in about 1600 and 2400 hours data at Nanshan and Kunming respectively, an intriguing peryton was detected at Nanshan, from which hundreds of bursts were recorded. Perytons are terrestrial radio signals that mimic celestial fast radio bursts. They were first reported at Parkes and identified as microwave oven interferences later. The bursts detected at Nanshan show similar frequency swept emission and have double-peaked profiles. They appeared in different sky regions in about tens of minutes observations and the dispersion measure index is not exactly 2, which indicates the terrestrial origin. The peryton differs drastically from the known perytons detected at Parkes, because it appeared in a precise period of $p=1.71287\pm 0.00004$ s. Its origin remains unknown.",astro-ph.HE

Its design is driven by six science goals which span three science themes: the physics of dark energy (measuring the expansion history and growth of the universe up to $z=6$), the physics of inflation (constraining primordial non-Gaussianity and primordial features) and the transient radio sky (detecting one million fast radio bursts and following up SKA-discovered pulsars). We propose two array configurations composed of hexagonally close-packed 6m dish arrangements with 50% fill factor. The initial 5,000 element 'petite array' is scientifically compelling, and can act as a demonstrator and a stepping stone to the full 32,000 element 'full array'. Viewed as a 21cm intensity mapping telescope, the program has the noise equivalent of a traditional spectroscopic galaxy survey comprised of 0.6 and 2.5 billion galaxies at a comoving wavenumber of $k=0.5\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ spanning the redshift range $z = 0.3 - 6$ for the petite and full configurations, respectively. At redshifts beyond $z=2$, the 21cm technique is a uniquely powerful way of mapping the universe, while the low-redshift range will allow for numerous cross-correlations with existing and upcoming surveys. This program is enabled by the development of ultra-wideband radio feeds, cost-effective dish construction methods, commodity radio-frequency electronics driven by the telecommunication industry and the emergence of sufficient computing power to facilitate real-time signal processing that exploits the full potential of massive radio arrays. The project has an estimated construction cost of 55 and 330 million FY19 USD for the petite and full array configurations. Including R&D, design, operations and science analysis, the cost rises to 125 and 600 million FY19 USD, respectively.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1907.12473,"Jie-Shuang Wang, Dong Lai, ",Fast radio burst counterparts and their implications for the central engine,"While the radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is unknown, coherent curvature radiation and synchrotron maser are promising candidates. We find that both radiation mechanisms work for a neutron star (NS) central engine with $B\gtrsim 10^{12}$ G, while for the synchrotron maser, the central engine can also be an accreting black hole (BH) with $B\gtrsim 10^{12}$ G and a white dwarf (WD) with $B\sim 10^8-10^9$ G. We study the electromagnetic counterparts associated with such central engines, i.e., nebulae for repeating FRBs and afterglows for non-repeating FRBs. In general, the energy spectrum and flux density of the counterpart depend strongly on its size and total injected energy. We apply the calculation to the nebula of FRB 121102 and find that the persistent radio counterpart requires the average energy injection rate into the nebula to be between $2.7\times10^{39}~{\rm erg/s}$ and $1.5\times10^{44}~{\rm erg/s}$, and the minimum injected energy be $6.0\times10^{47}~{\rm erg}$ in around $7$ yr. Consequently, we find that for FRB 121102 and its nebula: (1) WD and accretion BH central engines are disfavored; (2) a rotation-powered NS central engine works when $1.2\times10^{12}~{\rm G}\lesssim B\lesssim 7.8\times10^{14}~{\rm G}$ with initial period $P<180$ ms, but the radio emission must be more efficient than that in typical giant pulses of radio pulsars; and (3) a magnetic-powered NS central engine works when its internal magnetic field $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G. We also find that the radio-emitting electrons in the nebula could produce a significant rotation measure (RM), but cannot account for the entire observed RM of FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE

Especially, to constrain the time variability of the dark-energy, a new, standardisable candle that can reach more distant Universe has been awaited. Here we propose a new distance measure using fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are a new emerging population of $\sim$ ms time scale radio bursts that can reach high-$z$ in quantity. We show an empirical positive correlation between the time-integrated luminosity (L$_{\nu}$) and rest-frame intrinsic duration ($w_{\rm int,rest}$) of FRBs. The L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ correlation is with a weak strength but statistically very significant, i.e., Pearson coefficient is $\sim$ 0.5 with p-value of $\sim$0.038, despite the smallness of the current sample. This correlation can be used to measure intrinsic luminosity of FRBs from the observed $w_{\rm int,rest}$. By comparing the luminosity with observed flux, we measure luminosity distances to FRBs, and thereby construct the Hubble diagram. This FRB cosmology with the L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation has several advantages over SNe Ia, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and well-known FRB dispersion measure (DM)-$z$ cosmology; (i) access to higher redshift Universe beyond the SNe Ia, (ii) high event rate that is $\sim$ 3 order of magnitude more frequent than GRBs, and (iii) it is free from the uncertainty from intergalactic electron density models, i.e., we can remove the largest uncertainty in the well-debated DM-$z$ cosmology of FRB. Our simulation suggests that the L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation provides us with useful constraints on the time variability of the dark energy when the next generation radio telescopes start to find FRBs in quantity.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1907.10488,Bin Liu et al.,Prospects of strongly lensed repeating fast radio bursts: complementary constraints on dark energy evolution,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed and probably extragalactic radio flashes with millisecond-duration. Recently, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (using the CHIME/FRB instrument) has reported detections of 13 FRBs during a pre-commissioning phase. It is more exciting that one of the 13 FRBs is a second source of repeaters which suggests that CHIME/FRB and other wide-field sensitive radio telescopes will find a substantial population of repeating FRBs. We have proposed strongly lensed repeating FRBs as a precision cosmological probe, e.g. constraining the Hubble constant and model-independently estimating the cosmic curvature. Here, we study complementary constraints on the equation of state of dark energy from strongly lensed FRBs to currently available popular probes. It is found that, in the framework of Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, adding time delay measurement of 30 strongly lensed FRB systems to cosmic microwave background radiation and type Ia supernovae can improve the dark energy figure of merit by a factor 2. In the precision cosmology era, this improvement is of great significance for studying the nature of dark energy.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1907.10394,"Arthur G. Suvorov, Kostas D. Kokkotas, ",Young magnetars with fracturing crusts as fast radio burst repeaters,"Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration radio pulses of extragalactic origin. A recent statistical analysis has found that the burst energetics of the repeating source FRB 121102 follow a power-law, with an exponent that is curiously consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. This hints that repeat-bursters may be compact objects undergoing violent tectonic activity. For young magnetars, possessing crustal magnetic fields which are both strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) and highly multipolar, Hall drift can instigate significant field rearrangements even on $\lesssim$ century long timescales. This reconfiguration generates zones of magnetic stress throughout the outer layers of the star, potentially strong enough to facilitate frequent crustal failures. In this paper, assuming a quake scenario, we show how the crustal field evolution, which determines the resulting fracture geometries, can be tied to burst properties. Highly anisotropic stresses are generated by the rapid evolution of multipolar fields, implying that small, localised cracks can occur sporadically throughout the crust during the Hall evolution. Each of these shallow fractures may release bursts of energy, consistent in magnitude with those seen in the repeating sources FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73.",astro-ph.HE

However, the DM contribution from the IGM (${\rm DM_{IGM}}$) depends on the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$, which is not properly constrained. As $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ is geometrically related to the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and ${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$, here we propose that combining two independent measurements of FRBs and $H(z)$ in similar redshift ranges provides a novel and cosmology-free method to constrain the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$. Under the assumption that $f_{\rm IGM}$ is evolving with redshift in a functional form, we forecast that the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ can be well inferred in a combined analysis of $\sim3000$ ${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$ derived from FRBs and $\sim50$ $H(z)$ derived from the Hubble parameter data. Though the efficiency of our method is not as good as that of the other model-independent method involving the joint measurements of DM and luminosity distance of FRBs, our method offers a new model-independent way to constrain $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$.",astro-ph.CO

With Bayesian methods, we produce probability density functions for values of these measures. We distinguish between contributions from the intergalactic medium, the host galaxy and the local environment of the progenitor. To this end, we use constrained, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the local Universe to compute lines-of-sight integrals from the position of the Milky Way. In particular, we differentiate between predominantly astrophysical and primordial origins of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium. We test different possible types of host galaxies and probe different distribution functions of fast radio burst progenitor locations inside the host galaxy. Under the assumption that fast radio bursts are produced by magnetars, we use analytic predictions to account for the contribution of the local environment. We find that less than 100 fast radio bursts from magnetars in stellar-wind environments hosted by starburst dwarf galaxies at redshift $z \gtrsim 0.5$ suffice to discriminate between predominantly primordial and astrophysical origins of intergalactic magnetic fields. However, this requires the contribution of the Milky Way to be removed with a precision of $\approx 1 \rm~rad~m^{-2}$. We show the potential existence of a subset of fast radio bursts whose rotation measure carry information on the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field and its origins.",astro-ph.CO

Systematic searches for hard X/gamma-ray counterparts to other FRBs ended up with just lower limits on the radio/gamma-ray fluence ratios. In 2001, at the time of the earliest discovered FRBs, the BeppoSAX Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) was one of the most sensitive open sky gamma-ray monitors in the 40-700~keV energy band. During its lifetime, one of the FRBs with the highest radio fluence ever recorded, FRB010724 (800 +- 400 Jy ms), also known as the Lorimer burst, was promptly visible to the GRBM. Upon an accurate modeling of the GRBM background, eased by its equatorial orbit, we searched for a possible gamma-ray signal in the first 400 s following the FRB, similar to that claimed for FRB131104 and found no significant emission down to a 5-sigma limit in the range (0.24-4.7)x10^-6 erg cm^-2 (corresponding to 1 and 400 s integration time, respectively), in the energy band 40-700 keV. This corresponds to eta = F_radio/F_gamma>10^{8-9} Jy ms erg^-1 cm^2, i.e. the deepest limit on the ratio between radio and gamma-ray fluence, which rules out a gamma-ray counterpart similar to that of FRB131104.

The excess dispersions are likely accrued as fast radio bursts propagate through their host galaxies, gaseous galactic halos and the intergalactic medium [4,5]. Despite extensive follow-up observations of the published sample of 72 burst sources [6], only two are observed to repeat [7,8], and it is unknown whether or not the remainder are truly one-off events. Here I show that the volumetric occurrence rate of so far non-repeating fast radio bursts likely exceeds the rates of candidate cataclysmic progenitor events, and also likely exceeds the birth rates of candidate compact-object sources. This analysis is based on the high detection rate of bursts with low dispersion measures by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment [9].

Their extragalactic origins are evidenced by their large dispersion measures, which are greater than expected for propagation through the Milky Way interstellar medium alone, and imply contributions from the intergalactic medium and potentially host galaxies [2]. Although several theories exist for the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities, durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly magnetised plasma [3,4]. Two sources have been observed to repeat [5,6], and one repeater (FRB 121102) has been localised to the largest star-forming region of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 [7, 8]. However, the host galaxies and distances of the so far non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to be identified.

However, long-lived magnetars may also be created in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, in the small subset of cases with a sufficiently low total mass for the remnant to avoid collapse to a black hole, or in the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf. A BNS FRB channel will be characterized by distinct host galaxy and spatial offset distributions than the SLSNe/LGRB channel; we anticipate a similar host population, although possibly different offset distribution for AIC events. We show that both the BNS and AIC channels are consistent with the recently reported FRB 180924, localized by ASKAP to a massive quiescent host galaxy with an offset of about 1.4 effective radii. Using models calibrated to FRB 121102, we make predictions for the dispersion measure, rotation measure, and persistent radio emission from magnetar FRB sources born in BNS mergers or AIC, and show these are consistent with upper limits from FRB 180924 for reasonable parameters. Depending on the rate of AIC, and the fraction of BNS mergers leaving long-lived stable magnetars, the birth rate of repeating FRB sources associated with older stellar populations could be comparable to that of the core-collapse channel. We also discuss potential differences in the repetition properties of these channels, as a result of differences in the characteristic masses and magnetic fields of the magnetars.",astro-ph.HE

The large imaged field-of-view of TESS allows a search over the uncertainty region produced by MOST. However, the TESS pixel scale of 21"" and the Full Frame Image (FFI) cadence of 30 minutes is not optimal for the detection of an FOB with a possible millisecond duration. We search the TESS FFIs and find no events with a limiting TESS magnitude of 16, assuming a 30 minute event duration, corresponding to an optical flux density upper limit of approximately 2000 Jy for a ~ms signal duration, assuming no signal loss. In addition, the cosmic ray mitigation method for TESS significantly reduces its sensitivity to short timescale transients, which we quantify. We compare our results to the predictions of Yang, Zhang, and Wei (2019) and find that the upper limit is a factor of two thousand higher than the predicted maximum optical flux density. However, we find that if FRB181228 had occurred in the galaxy thought to host the nearest FRB detection to date (37 Mpc), an FOB may have been detectable by TESS. In the near future, when CHIME and ASKAP will detect hundreds to thousands of FRBs, TESS may be able to detect FOBs from those rare bright and nearby FRBs within this large population (if more sophisticated cosmic ray excision can be implemented).",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1906.09559,"Rachid Ouyed, Denis Leahy, Nico Koning, ",A Quark-Nova in the wake of a core-collapse Supernova: a unifying model for long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts and Fast Radio Bursts,"[Abridged] By appealing to a Quark-Nova (QN; the explosive transition of a neutron star to a quark star) in the wake of a core-collapse Supernova explosion of a massive star, we develop a unified model for long duration Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The time delay (years to decades) between the SN and the QN and, the fragmented nature (i.e. millions of chunks) of the relativistic QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine. In our model, a LGRB light-curve exhibits the interaction of the fragmented QN ejecta with a turbulent (i.e. filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta which is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The afterglow is due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN ejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model can fit BAT/XRT prompt and afterglow light-curves, simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding the observed properties of LGRBs (e.g. the Band function and the X-ray flares). We find that the Yonetoku law and the Amati law are not fundamental but phenomenological. FRBs result from coherent synchrotron emission when the QN chunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where conditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification induced by the Weibel instability sets the bunching length for electrons and pairs to radiate coherently. The resulting emission frequency, luminosity, duration and dispersion measure in our model are consistent with FRB data. We find a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs to LGRBs including X-ray Flashes and X-ray rich GRBs as well as Super-Luminous SNe. We find a possible connection between Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and FRBs and propose that a QN following a binary neutron star merger can yield a short GRB (SGRB) with fits to BAT/XRT light-curves.",astro-ph.HE

Further, in the model under consideration, Penrose diagrams will be constructed, which share common features with Schwarzschild solutions of positive and negative mass, whose combination the model is.

In order to avoid the uncertainty in estimating $\rm DM_{host}$ due to the line-of-sight effect, we propose a galaxy-group-based method to estimate the electron density in the inter-galactic regions, and hence, $\rm DM_{IGM}$. The result strengthens our conclusion.

The FRB field is guaranteed to be exciting: new telescopes will expand the sample from the current ~80 unique burst sources (and a few secure localizations and redshifts) to thousands, with burst localizations that enable host-galaxy redshifts emerging directly from interferometric surveys.   * FRBs are now established as an extragalactic phenomenon.   * Only a few sources are known to repeat.

For the first time, the metallicity effect on the formation rate is considered. If FRBs are produced by the mergers of compact binaries, the formation rate of FRBs should have a time delay relative to cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). We get the time delay is about 3-5 Gyr and the index of differential energy function $\gamma$ ($dN/dE\propto E^{-\gamma}$) is between 1.6 and 2.0 from redshift cumulative distribution. The value of $\gamma$ is similar to that of FRB 121102, which indicates single bursts may share the same physical mechanism with the repeaters. In another case, if the formation rate of FRB is proportional to the SFR without time delay, the index $\gamma$ is about 2.3. In both cases, we find that FRBs may prefer to occur in low-metallicity environment with $ 12 +\log(\rm{O/H}) \simeq 8.40$, which is similar to those of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I).",astro-ph.HE

We show this can be considered mathematically equivalent to the one dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in a different Fourier space. As a result, familiar concepts in two dimensional intensity interferometry designed to correctly account for a range of instrumental conditions can be translated to the analysis of Faraday dispersion. In particular, we show how to model the effect of channel averaging during Faraday reconstruction, which has to date limited the progress of polarimetic science using wide-band measurements. Further, we simulate 1d sparse reconstruction with channel averaging for realistic frequency coverages, and show that it is possible to recover signals with large rotation measure values that were previously excluded from possible detection. This is especially important for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extended these ideas to introduce mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work, thus provides the first framework for correctly undertaking wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the provision to add data from multiple telescopes, a prospect that should vastly improve the quality and quantity of polarimetric science. This is of particular importance for extreme environments which generate high magnetic fields such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will allow such sources to be accurately used as probes of cosmological fields.",astro-ph.IM

The FRB signals would therefore have to propagate through the expanding SN ejecta.

Each RM was estimated using a brute-force search over trial RMs that spanned the maximum measurable range $\pm1.18 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{rad \, m^2}$ (in steps of 1 $\mathrm{rad \, m^2}$), followed by an iterative refinement algorithm. The measured RRAT RMs are in the range |RM| $\sim 1$ to $\sim 950$ rad m$^{-2}$ with an average linear polarization fraction of $\sim 40$ per cent. Individual single pulses are observed to be up to 100 per cent linearly polarized. The RMs of the RRATs and the corresponding inferred average magnetic fields (parallel to the line-of-sight and weighted by the free electron density) are observed to be consistent with the Galactic plane pulsar population. Faraday rotation analyses are typically performed on accumulated pulsar data, for which hundreds to thousands of pulses have been integrated, rather than on individual pulses. Therefore, we verified the iterative refinement algorithm by performing Monte Carlo simulations of artificial single pulses over a wide range of S/N and RM. At and above a S/N of 17 in linearly polarized flux, the iterative refinement recovers the simulated RM value 100 per cent of the time with a typical mean uncertainty of $\sim5$ rad m$^{-2}$.

We find that a detectable FOB with the current and forthcoming telescopes is possible under the IC scenarios with very special conditions. In particular, the FRB environment would need to invoke a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field and an extremely fast spin, or an extremely young supernova remnant (SNR) surrounding the FRB source. Furthermore, most electrons in the source are also required to have a fine-tuned energy distribution such that most of the IC energy is channeled in the optical band.

I outline how to optimise spectral and temporal resolution for FRB surveys that are throughput-limited.

Motivated by this correspondence, we propose that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\sim 1$ GHz radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio pulse duration to $\sim1$ ms. Within the framework of our model, the current dataset of the polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic obliquity $\alpha\lesssim40^\circ$ and viewing angle $\zeta$ with respect to the spin axis $\alpha<\zeta<180^\circ-\alpha$.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1904.11618,"Shifan Zuo, Xuelei Chen, ",A Radio Burst Detection Method Based on the Hough Transform,"We present a simple and fast method for incoherent dedispersion and fast radio burst (FRB) detection based on the Hough transform, which is widely used for feature extraction in image analysis. The Hough transform maps a point in the time-frequency data to a straight line in the parameter space, and points on the same dispersed $f^{-2}$ curve to a bundle of lines all crossing at the same point, thus the curve is transformed to a single point in the parameter space, enabling an easier way for the detection of radio burst. By choosing an appropriate truncation threshold, in a reasonably radio quiet environment, i.e. with radio frequency interferences (RFIs) present but not dominant, the computing speed of the method is very fast. Using simulation data of different noise levels, we studied how the detected peak varies with different truncation thresholds. We also tested the method with some real pulsar and FRB data.",astro-ph.IM

It does this by focussing on global properties like the shape and connectivity of the data giving it a significant advantage over more conventional tools based on cluster analysis, a localised property of the data. However, some of its mathematical foundations, like algebraic topology and discrete Morse theory, are perceived as an intimidatingly steep upramp into the subject. Consequently, it has enjoyed much less popularity as a data-analysis tool than less abstract methods. This article aims to change this. By focusing on a small set of simple examples, chosen primarily for their pedagogical value, we introduce and explain TDA's two principle branches; persistent homology and the Mapper algorithm. We then illustrate the universality of the method by discussing its application to the intriguing data set of fast radio burst (FRB) observations. We close the article with a discussion of the resilience of topological data analysis to noise and some statistical and computational challenges faced by the method.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1904.08927,Zhengxiang Li et al.,Cosmology-independent estimate of the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM from fast radio burst observations,"The excessive dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been proposed to be a powerful tool to study intergalactic medium (IGM) and to perform cosmography. One issue is that the fraction of baryons in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$, is not properly constrained. Here we propose a method of estimating $f_{\rm IGM}$ using a putative sample of FRBs with the measurements of both DM and luminosity distance $d_{\rm L}$. The latter can be obtained if the FRB is associated with a distance indicator (e.g. a gamma-ray burst or a gravitational wave event), or the redshift $z$ of the FRB is measured and $d_{\rm L}$ at the corresponding $z$ is available from other distance indicators (e.g. type Ia supernovae) at the same redshift. Since $d_{\rm L}/{\rm DM}$ essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method can determine $f_{\rm IGM}$ independent of cosmological parameters. We parameterize $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift and model the DM contribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming $f_{\rm IGM}$ has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by means of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and cosmology-independent estimate of the present value of $f_{\rm IGM}$ with a $\sim 12\%$ uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of $d_{\rm L}$ and DM. In addition, such a method can also lead to a measurement of the mean value of DM contributed from the local host galaxy.",astro-ph.CO

We are motivated by the persistent radio source associated with the fast radio burst FRB 121102, which was explained by Waxman as a weak stellar explosion with a small ($\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$) mildly relativistic mass ejection that may be consistent with AIC. Additionally, the interaction of the relatively low ejected mass with a pre-collapse wind might be related to fast optical transients. The AIC is simulated with a one-dimensional, Lagrangian, Newtonian hydrodynamic code. We put an emphasis on accurately treating the equation of state and the nuclear burning, which is required for any study that attempts to accurately simulate AIC. We leave subjects such as neutrino physics and general relativity corrections for future work. Using an existing initial profile and our own initial profiles, we find that the ejected mass is $\sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}M_{\odot}$ over a wide range of parameters, and we construct a simple model to explain our results.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1904.07947,"E. Petroff, J. W. T. Hessels, D. R. Lorimer, ",Fast Radio Bursts,"The discovery of radio pulsars over a half century ago was a seminal moment in astronomy. It demonstrated the existence of neutron stars, gave a powerful observational tool to study them, and has allowed us to probe strong gravity, dense matter, and the interstellar medium. More recently, pulsar surveys have led to the serendipitous discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). While FRBs appear similar to the individual pulses from pulsars, their large dispersive delays suggest that they originate from far outside the Milky Way and hence are many orders-of-magnitude more luminous. While most FRBs appear to be one-off, perhaps cataclysmic events, two sources are now known to repeat and thus clearly have a longer-lived central engine. Beyond understanding how they are created, there is also the prospect of using FRBs -- as with pulsars -- to probe the extremes of the Universe as well as the otherwise invisible intervening medium. Such studies will be aided by the high implied all-sky event rate: there is a detectable FRB roughly once every minute occurring somewhere on the sky. The fact that less than a hundred FRB sources have been discovered in the last decade is largely due to the small fields-of-view of current radio telescopes. A new generation of wide-field instruments is now coming online, however, and these will be capable of detecting multiple FRBs per day. We are thus on the brink of further breakthroughs in the short-duration radio transient phase space, which will be critical for differentiating between the many proposed theories for the origin of FRBs. In this review, we give an observational and theoretical introduction at a level that is accessible to astronomers entering the field.",astro-ph.HE

A direct application of this algorithm is radio interferometric calibration of raw data at fine time and frequency resolution. Almost all existing radio interferometric calibration algorithms assume that it is possible to fit the dataset being calibrated into memory. Therefore, the raw data is averaged in time and frequency to reduce its size by many orders of magnitude before calibration is performed. However, this averaging is detrimental for the detection of some signals of interest that have narrow bandwidth and time duration such as fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the proposed algorithm, it is possible to calibrate data at such a fine resolution that they cannot be entirely loaded into memory, thus preserving such signals. As an additional demonstration, we use the proposed algorithm for training deep neural networks and compare the performance against the mainstream first order optimization algorithms that are used in deep learning.",astro-ph.IM

Here we consider a simple model where all the FRBs have the same spectral index $\alpha$ and rest frame energy $E$ (specified in a fixed band $2128\;{\rm MHz}$ to $2848\;{\rm MHz}$). We find that the constraints on $(\alpha,E)$ depend on the scattering model for pulse broadening in the inter-galactic medium. For no scattering we find that there is a region of parameter space where the predictions are simultaneously consistent with the FRB redshift and fluence distributions at all three telescopes. The allowed $\alpha$ range is bounded by $-6.0\leq \alpha \leq-3.6$ and the allowed $E$ range is bounded by $1.79\times 10^{33}{\rm J} \leq E \leq 5.41\times 10^{33}{\rm J}$.

arXiv:1903.12186,Almog Yalinewich et al.,Fast Radio Bursts from Terraformation,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, as the name implies, short and intense pulses of radiation at wavelengths of roughly one metre. FRBs have extremely high brightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The energy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high end of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized planet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the radiation can be readily produced by astrophysical masers. We refer to this mechanism as Volatile Amplification of a Destructive Emission of Radiation (VADER). We use the observational information to constrain the properties of the apparatus. We speculate that the non-repeating FRBs are low-energy pulses used to exterminate life on a single planet, but leaving it otherwise intact, and that the stronger repeating FRB is part of an effort to destroy multiple objects in the same solar system, perhaps as a preventative measure against panspermia. In this picture, the persistent synchrotron source associated with the first repeating FRB arises from the energy harvesting process. Finally we propose that Oumuamua might have resulted from a destruction of a planet in this manner.",astro-ph.HE

Recently, FRB 200428 was detected in temporal coincidence with a hard X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which supports that at least some FRBs are from magnetar activity. Interestingly, a portion of X-ray flares from magnetar XTE J1810-197 and the Sun are also accompanied by radio bursts. Many features of Galactic FRB 200428 and cosmological FRBs resemble solar radio bursts. However, a common physical origin among FRBs, magnetar radio pulses and solar radio bursts has not yet been established. Here we report a universal correlation between X-ray luminosity and radio luminosity over twenty orders of magnitude among solar type III radio bursts, XTE J1810-197 and Galactic FRB 200428. This universal correlation reveals that the energetic electrons which produce the X-ray flares and those which cause radio emissions have a common origin, which can give stringent limits on the generation process of radio bursts. Moreover, we find similar occurrence frequency distributions of energy, duration and waiting time for solar radio bursts, SGR 1935+2154 and repeating FRB 121102, which also support the tight correlation and the X-ray flares temporally associated with radio bursts. All of these distributions can be understood by avalanche models of self-organized criticality systems. The universal correlation and statistical similarities indicate that the Galactic FRB 200428 and FRBs seen at cosmological distances can be treated as scaled-up solar radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

The optical fast transient sky is still largely unexplored, with only a few surveys to date having placed meaningful constraints on the detection of extragalactic transients evolving at sub-hour timescales. Here, we present the results of deep searches for dim, minute-timescale extragalactic fast transients using the Dark Energy Camera, a core facility of our all-wavelength and all-messenger Deeper, Wider, Faster programme. We used continuous 20s exposures to systematically probe timescales down to 1.17 minutes at magnitude limits $g > 23$ (AB), detecting hundreds of transient and variable sources. Nine candidates passed our strict criteria on duration and non-stellarity, all of which could be classified as flare stars based on deep multi-band imaging. Searches for fast radio burst and gamma-ray counterparts during simultaneous multi-facility observations yielded no counterparts to the optical transients. Also, no long-term variability was detected with pre-imaging and follow-up observations using the SkyMapper optical telescope. We place upper limits for minute-timescale fast optical transient rates for a range of depths and timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that optical $g$-band light curve behaviour alone cannot discriminate between confirmed extragalactic fast transients such as prompt GRB flashes and Galactic stellar flares.",astro-ph.HE

We convert this dark matter particle number density to the corresponding free electron density and then integrate it to find the DM as a function of redshift.

For the maximum redshift of $z=0.11$, the ten-year upper limit of luminosity is $7.32\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We utilize these upper limits to constrain the FRB progenitor and central engine. For the rotation-powered young magnetar model, the upper limits can pose constraints on the allowed parameter space for the initial rotational period and surface magnetic field of the magnetar. We also place significant constraints on the kinetic energy of a relativistic external shock wave, ruling out the possibility that there existed a gamma-ray burst (GRB) beaming towards earth during the past ten years as the progenitor of the repeater.

arXiv:1903.06384,"Adam Rogers, Xinzhong Er, ",Dual-Component Plasma Lens Models,"In contrast to the converging, achromatic behaviour of axisymmetric gravitational lenses, diverging frequency-dependent lensing occurs from refraction due to a distribution of over-dense axisymmetric plasma along an observer's line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify and dim the appearance of background sources as a function of frequency. Plasma lensing is believed to be involved in a number of separate phenomena involving the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events of background radio sources and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts. These lensing phenomena are believed to occur in dense environments, in which there may be many density perturbations between an observer and background source. In this work we generalize individual plasma lens models to produce dual component lenses using families of plasma lens models previously studied in the literature, namely the exponential and softened power-law lenses. Similar to binary gravitational lens models, these dual component plasma lenses feature a rich and complex critical and caustic morphology, as well as generate more complicated light curves. We map the number of criticals formed for a given component separation and angular size, and highlight a relevant degeneracy between two particular models.

We propose a generic geometrical model to account for the observed downward drifting of sub-pulse frequency, within the framework of coherent curvature radiation by bunches of electrons or positrons in the magnetosphere of a neutron star. A sudden trigger event excites these coherent bunches of charged particles, which stream outwards along open field lines. As the field lines sweep across the line of sight, the bunches seen later have traveled farther into the less curved part of the magnetic field lines, thus emitting at lower frequencies. We use this model to explain the time-frequency downward drifting in two FRB generation scenarios, the transient pulsar-like sparking from the inner gap region of a slowly rotating neutron star, and the externally-triggered magnetosphere reconfiguration known as the ""cosmic comb"".",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1903.02249,K. Gourdji et al.,A sample of low energy bursts from FRB 121102,"We present 41 bursts from the first repeating fast radio burst discovered (FRB 121102). A deep search has allowed us to probe unprecedentedly low burst energies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the Arecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a third of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB signals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are likely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a striking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA observations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one that was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies that vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution of burst energies yields an index $-1.8\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the previously reported value of $\sim-0.7$. The discrepancy may be evidence for a more complex energy distribution. We place constraints on the possibility that the associated persistent radio source is generated by the emission of many faint bursts ($\sim700$ ms$^{-1}$). We do not see a connection between burst fluence and wait time. The distribution of wait times follows a log-normal distribution centered around $\sim200$ s; however, some bursts have wait times below 1 s and as short as 26 ms, which is consistent with previous reports of a bimodal distribution. We caution against exclusively integrating over the full observing band during FRB searches, because this can lower signal-to-noise.",astro-ph.HE

We first consider a simplified model of a power-law volumetric rate per unit isotropic energy dN/dE ~ E^{-gamma} with a maximum energy E_max in a uniform Euclidean Universe. This provides analytic insights for what can be learnt from these distributions. We find that the observed cumulative DM distribution scales as N(>DM) ~ DM^{5-2*gamma} (for gamma > 1) until a maximum value DM_max above which bursts near E_max fall below the fluence threshold of a given telescope. Comparing this model with the observed fluence and DM distributions, we find a reasonable fit for gamma ~ 1.7 and E_max ~ 10^{33} erg/Hz. We then carry out a full Bayesian analysis based on a Schechter rate function with cosmological factor. We find roughly consistent results with our analytical approach, although with large errors on the inferred parameters due to the small sample size.

Breysse, ",Statistical inference of the distance to ASKAP FRBs,"The distances to fast radio bursts (FRBs) are crucial for understanding their underlying engine, and for their use as cosmological probes. In this paper, we provide three statistical estimates of the distance to ASKAP FRBs. First, we show that the number of events of similar luminosity in ASKAP does not scale as distance cubed, as one would expect, when directly using the observed dispersion measure (DM) to infer distance. Second, by comparing the average DMs of FRBs observed with different instruments, we estimated the average redshift of ASKAP FRBs to be $z\sim 0.01$ using CHIME and ASKAP, and $z\lesssim0.07$ using Parkes and ASKAP. Both values are much smaller than the upper limit $z\sim0.3$ estimated directly from the DM. Third, we cross-correlate the locations of the ASKAP FRBs with existing large-area redshift surveys, and see a 3$\sigma$ correlation with the 2MASS Redshift Survey and a 5$\sigma$ correlation with the HI Parkes All Sky Survey at $z\sim0.007$. This corresponds well with the redshift of the most likely host galaxy of ASKAP FRB 171020, which is at $z=0.00867$. These arguments combined suggest an extremely nearby origin of ASKAP FRBs and a local environment with accumulated electrons that contribute a DM of several hundred pc/cm$^3$, which should be accounted for in theoretical models.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper we study the use of FRBs for tracing the epoch of HeII reionization, using simulations of their dispersion measures. We model dispersion measure contributions from the Milky Way, the IGM (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) and a possible host galaxy as a function of redshift and star formation rate. We estimate the number of FRBs required to distinguish between a model of the Universe in which helium reionization occurred at z = 3 from a model in which it occurred at z = 6 using a 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. We find that if the IGM is homogeneous >1100 FRBs are needed and that an inhomogeneous model in which traversal of the FRB pulse through galaxy halos increases the number of FRBs modestly, to >1600. We also find that to distinguish between a reionization that occurred at z = 3 or z = 3.5 requires ~5700 FRBs in the range 3 < z < 5.",astro-ph.HE

Law et al. (2018) showed that FIRST J1419+3940 is a transient source decaying in brightness over the last few decades. One possible interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is a nearby analogue to FRB 121102 and that the radio emission represents a young magnetar nebula (as several scenarios assume for FRB 121102). Another interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is the afterglow of an `orphan' long gamma-ray burst (GRB). The environment is similar to where most such events are produced. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted radio observations using the European VLBI Network at 1.6 GHz to spatially resolve the emission and to search for millisecond-duration radio bursts. We detect FIRST J1419+3940 as a compact radio source with a flux density of $620 \pm 20\ \mathrm{\mu Jy}$ (on 2018 September 18) and a source size of $3.9 \pm 0.7\ \mathrm{mas}$ (i.e. $1.6 \pm 0.3\ \mathrm{pc}$ given the angular diameter distance of $83\ \mathrm{Mpc}$). These results confirm that the radio emission is non-thermal and imply an average expansion velocity of $(0.10 \pm 0.02)c$. Contemporaneous high-time-resolution observations using the 100-m Effelsberg telescope detected no millisecond-duration bursts of astrophysical origin. The source properties and lack of short-duration bursts are consistent with a GRB jet expansion, whereas they disfavor a magnetar birth nebula.",astro-ph.HE

We present 11 deep learning models, each with an accuracy and recall above 99.5% on our test dataset comprising of real RFI and pulsar candidates. As we demonstrate, these algorithms are telescope and frequency agnostic and are able to detect all FRBs with signal-to-noise ratios above 10 in ASKAP and Parkes data.

One model proposed to interpret the only known repeating object, FRB 121102, is that the radio emission is generated from asteroids colliding with a highly magnetized neutron star (NS). With N-body simulations, we model a debris disc around a central star with an eccentric orbit intruding NS. As the NS approaches the first periastron passage, most of the comets are scattered away rather than being accreted by the NS. To match the observed FRB rate, the debris belt would have to be at least three orders of magnitude more dense than the Kuiper belt. We also consider the rate of collisions on to the central object but find that the density of the debris belt must be at least four orders of magnitude more dense than the Kuiper belt. These discrepancies in the density arise even if (1) one introduces a Kuiper-belt like comet belt rather than an asteroid belt and assume that comet impacts can also make FRBs; (2) the NS moves 2 orders of magnitude slower than their normal proper-motion velocity due to supernova kicks; and (3) the NS orbit is coplanar to the debris belt, which provides the highest rate of collisions.",astro-ph.HE

Applied to the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder's (ASKAP's) Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) `lat50' survey, the presence of an FRB similar to FRB 121102 is excluded within a volume of $1.9 \cdot 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ at 95% confidence level (C.L.). Assuming a burst energy cut-off at $10^{42}$ erg, the 95% C.L. upper limit on the population density of repeating FRBs in the current epoch is $27$ Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming isotropic (unbeamed) emission. This number is much lower than expected from even rare scenarios such as magnetar formation in gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the maximally allowed population under-predicts the observed number of single bursts in the survey. Comparisons with the observed dispersion measure distribution favours a larger population of less rapidly repeating objects, or the existence of a second population of non-repeating FRBs.

In particular, we only consider the possible dipole in FRBs, rather than the cosmic anisotropy in general, while the analysis is only concerned with finding the rough number of necessary data points to distinguish a dipole from a monopole structure through simulations. Noting that there is no a large sample of actual data of FRBs with known redshifts by now, simulations are necessary to this end. We find that at least 2800, 190, 100 FRBs are competent to find the cosmic dipole with amplitude 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. Unfortunately, even 10000 FRBs are not competent to find the tiny cosmic dipole with amplitude of ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$.

Millicharged dark matter affects the dispersion measure of the time of arrival of radio pulses in a way analogous to free electrons. Light pseudo-scalar dark matter, on the other hand, causes the polarization angle of radio signals to oscillate. We show that current and future data can set strong constraints in both cases. For dark matter particles of charge $\epsilon e$, these constraints are ${\epsilon}/{m_{\rm milli}} \lesssim 10^{-8}{\rm eV}^{-1}$, for masses $m_{\rm milli}\gtrsim 10^{-6}\,$eV. For axion-like particles, the analysis of signals from pulsars yields constraints in the axial coupling of the order of $g/m_a\lesssim 10^{-13} {\rm GeV}^{-1}/(10^{-22}{\rm eV})$. Both bounds scale as $(\rho/\rho_{\rm dm})^{1/2}$ if the energy density $\rho$ of the components is a fraction of the total dark matter energy density $\rho_{\rm dm}$. We do a detailed study of both effects using data from two samples of pulsars in the galaxy and in globular clusters, as well as data from FRB 121102 and PSR J0437$-$4715.

The observation of such an event would require black hole masses much smaller than a solar mass, which could be provided by primordial black hole dark matter models. We discuss the low energy isotropic background emissions produced by decaying primordial black holes at all epochs and derive constraints from the spectrum of the extragalactic background light. We find that, in order to avoid exceeding known extragalactic background light emissions, we must restrict the total energy emitted at low frequencies by a planck star exploding in the present epoch to be less than $10^{13}$ erg or restrict the primordial black hole population far below any existing limits.

Metzger, Ben Margalit, Lorenzo Sironi, ",Fast radio bursts as synchrotron maser emission from decelerating relativistic blast waves,"Fast radio bursts (FRB) can arise from synchrotron maser emission at ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks, such as produced by flare ejecta from young magnetars. We combine PIC simulation results for the synchrotron maser with the dynamics of self-similar shock deceleration, as commonly applied to GRBs, to explore the implications for FRB emission. We assume the upstream environment into which the ultra-relativistic ejecta collides is a mildly relativistic baryon-loaded shell released following a previous flare, motivated by the high electron-ion injection rate Mdot ~ 1e19-1e21 g/s needed on larger scales to power the persistent radio nebula coincident with the repeating burster FRB 121102 and its high inferred rotation measure. The observed radio fluence peaks once the optical depth ahead of the shock to induced Compton scattering decreases to <~ few, a condition which places a GHz observer on the high frequency tail of the maser SED. Given intervals between ion shell ejection events ~1e5 s similar to the occurrence rate of the most powerful bursts from FRB 121102, we demonstrate the production of FRBs of frequency ~ 0.1-10 GHz, isotropic radiated energies ~1e37-1e40 erg and durations ~0.1-10 ms for flares of energy ~1e43-1e45 erg. Deceleration of the blast wave, and increasing transparency of the upstream medium, generates a temporal decay of the peak frequency, similar to the downward drift seen in the sub-bursts of FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73. The delay >~ 1e5 s between major ion-injection events needed to clear sufficiently low densities around the engine for FRB emission could explain prolonged ""dark"" periods and clustered burst arrival times, and lead to stochastic variation in the dispersion measure.

Attaining more burst spectra could lead to a better understanding of the origin of these bright, millisecond-duration radio pulses. We therefore performed $\sim$20 hr of simultaneous observations on FRB 121102 with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to constrain the spectral behaviour of bursts from FRB 121102 at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz. This campaign resulted in the detection of nine new bursts at 1.4 GHz but no simultaneous detections with LOFAR. Assuming that the ratio of the fluence at two frequencies scales as a power law, we placed a lower limit of $\alpha$ > -1.2 $\pm$ 0.4 on the spectral index for the fluence of the instantaneous broad band emission of FRB 121102. For the derivation of this limit, a realistic fluence detection threshold for LOFAR was determined empirically assuming a burst would be scattered as predicted by the NE2001 model. A significant variation was observed in the burst repeat rate R at L-band. During observations in September 2016, nine bursts were detected, giving R = 1.1 $\pm$ 0.4 hr$^{-1}$, while in November no bursts were detected, yielding R < 0.3 hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). This variation is consistent with earlier seen episodic emission of FRB 121102. In a blind and targeted search, no bursts were found with LOFAR at 150 MHz, resulting in a repeat rate limit of R < 0.16 hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit).

In a cold plasma, the conversion occurs at the localized regions along the wave's path, where the large-scale magnetic field is perpendicular to the propagation direction.

In one scenario, an exponential distribution for the intrinsic wait times between pulses is chosen, and in a second scenario we model the observed pulse arrival times to follow a Weibull distribution. For both models we determine whether the FRB source would be deemed a repeater based on the telescope sensitivity and time spent on follow-up observations. We are unable to rule out the existence of a single FRB population based on comparisons of our simulations with the longest FRB follow-up observations performed. We however rule out the possibility of FRBs 171020 and 010724 repeating with the same rate statistics as FRB 121102 and also constrain the slope of a power-law fit to the FRB energy distribution to be $-2.0 < \gamma <-1.0$.

We then review current empirical constraints on halo gas in distant galaxies and discuss the implications for their DM contributions. We further examine the DM probability distribution function of a population of FRBs at z >> 0 using an updated halo mass function and new models for the halo density profile.

Since the discovery of the first FRB in 2007, tens of similar events have been detected. However, their physical origin remains unclear, and a number of scenarios even larger than the number of known FRBs has been proposed during these years. The presence of repeating bursts in FRB 121102 allowed us to perform a precise localization of the source with the Very Large Array and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Optical observations with Keck, Gemini and HST unveiled the host to be a low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of 0.193. The EVN results showed that the bursts are co-located (within a projected separation of $< 40$ pc) to a compact and persistent radio source with a size of $< 0.7$ pc inside a star-forming region. This environment resembles the ones where superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long gamma-ray bursts are produced. Although the nature of this persistent source and the origin of the bursts remain unknown, scenarios considering a pulsar/magnetar energizing a young SLSN, or a system with a pulsar/magnetar in the vicinity of a massive black hole are the most plausible ones to date. More recent observations have shown that the bursts from FRB 121102 are almost 100% linearly polarized at an unexpectedly high and variable Faraday rotation measure, that has been observed to date only in vicinities of massive black holes. The bursts are thus likely produced from a neutron star in such environment, although the system can still be explained by a young neutron star embedded in a highly magnetized nebula. Upcoming interferometric searches are expected to report tens of these localizations in the coming years, unveil if this source is representative of the whole population or a particular case, and dramatically boosting the field of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Our low-scattering events suggest that efforts to detect FRBs at radio frequencies below 400 MHz will eventually be successful.

Thanks to its repetition, the source was well localized with a subarcsecond accuracy, leading to a redshift measurement of about 0.2. FRB 121102 is a unique source that can help us understand the enigmatic nature of fast radio bursts. In this study, we analyze the characteristics of the waiting times between bursts from FRB 121102. It is found that there is a clear bimodal distribution for the waiting times. While most waiting times cluster at several hundred seconds, a small portion of the waiting times are strikingly in the range of 2--40 millisecond. More interestingly, it is found that the waiting time does not correlate with the burst intensity, either for the preceding burst or for the subsequent burst. It strongly indicates that the repeating bursts should be generated by some external mechanisms, but not internal mechanisms.

We perform particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks in cold pair plasmas, checking our results for consistency among three PIC codes. We confirm that a linearly polarized X-mode wave is self-consistently generated by the shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We find that at magnetizations $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy flux of the pre-shock flow) the shock converts a fraction $f_\xi' \approx 7 \times 10^{-4}/\sigma^2$ of the total incoming energy into the precursor wave, as measured in the shock frame. The wave spectrum is narrow-band (fractional width $\lesssim 1-3$), with apparent but not dominant line-like features as many resonances concurrently contribute. The peak frequency in the pre-shock (observer) frame is $\omega^{\prime \prime}_{\rm peak} \approx 3 \gamma_{\rm s | u} \omega_{\rm p}$, where $\gamma_{\rm s|u}$ is the shock Lorentz factor in the upstream frame and $\omega_{\rm p}$ the plasma frequency. At $\sigma\gtrsim1$, where our estimated $\omega''_{\rm peak}$ differs from previous works, the shock structure presents two solitons separated by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds to an eigenmode of the cavity.

We use Illustris Simulation to realistically estimate the scatter in the dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of ionized gas in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We find ~13% scatter in DM to a source at z=1 and ~7% at z=3 (one sigma). The distribution of DM is close to Gaussian. We simulate samples of FRBs and examine their applicability to simple cosmological tests. Our calculations show that using a sample of 100 FRBs and fixing cosmological model one can find the redshift and sample averaged fraction of ionized gas with ~1% uncertainty. Finding the ionized fraction with ~1% accuracy at few different epochs would require ~10 000 FRBs with known redshifts. Because DM is proportional to the product of ionized fraction, baryon density and the Hubble constant it is impossible to constrain these parameters separately with FRBs. Constraints on cosmological densities are possible in a flat LCDM model but give uninterestingly low accuracy. Using FRBs with other type of data improves the constraints, but the role of FRBs is not crucial. Thus constraints on the distribution of ionized gas are probably the most promising application of FRBs which allow for ""tomography"" if sources redshifts are known, as opposed to measuring electron scattering optical depth or S-Z y parameters with CMB observations.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1812.11810,"Ranjan Laha, ",Lensing of fast radio bursts: future constraints on primordial black hole density with an extended mass function and a new probe of exotic compact fermion and boson stars,"The discovery of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers has renewed interest in primordial black holes forming a part of the dark matter density of our Universe. Various tests have been proposed to test this hypothesis. One of the cleanest tests is the lensing of fast radio bursts. In this situation, the presence of a compact object near the line of sight produces two images of the radio burst. If the images are sufficiently separated in time, this technique can constrain the presence of primordial black holes. One can also try to detect the lensed image of the mini-bursts within the main burst. We show that this technique can produce the leading constraints over a wide range in lens masses $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_\odot$ if the primordial black holes follow a single mass distribution. Even if the primordial black holes have an extended mass distribution, the constraints that can be derived from lensing of fast radio bursts will be the most constraining over wide ranges of the parameter space. We show that this technique can probe exotic compact boson stars and fermion stars made up of beyond the Standard Model particles. This search strategy is competitive and can provide the leading constraints on parts of the particle physics parameter space when compared with gravitational wave observations.",astro-ph.CO

We developed a generic formalism (Bera {\em et al.}, 2016) to estimate the FRB detection rate for any radio telescope with given parameters. By using this model, we estimated the FRB detection rate for two Indian radio telescope; the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA) (Bhattacharyya {\em et al.}, 2017) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Bhattacharyya {\em et al.}, 2018) with three beam forming modes. In this review article, I summarize these two works. We considered the energy spectrum of FRBs as a power law and the energy distribution of FRBs as a Dirac delta function and a Schechter luminosity function. We also considered two scattering models proposed by Bhat {\em et al.} (2004) and Macquart \& Koay (2013) for these work and I consider FRB pulse without scattering as a special case for this review. We found that the future prospects of detecting FRBs by using these two Indian radio telescopes is good. They are capable to detect a significant number of FRBs per day. According to our prediction, we can detect $\sim 10^5-10^8$, $\sim 10^3-10^6$ and $\sim 10^5-10^7$ FRBs per day by using OWFA, commensal systems of GMRT and uGMRT respectively.

Here we show that besides rotation of the linear-polarisation vector (Faraday rotation), such media can generally convert linear to circular polarisation (Faraday conversion). We use non-detection of Faraday conversion, and the temporal variation in Faraday rotation and dispersion in bursts from FRB\,121102 to constrain models where the progenitor inflates a relativistic nebula (persistent source) confined by a cold dense medium (e.g. supernova ejecta). We find that the persistent synchrotron source, if composed of an electron-proton plasma, must be an admixture of relativistic and non-relativistic (Lorentz factor $\gamma<5$) electrons. Furthermore we independently constrain the magnetic field in the cold confining medium, which provides the Faraday rotation, to be between $10$ and $30\,$mG. This value is close to the equipartition magnetic field of the confined persistent source implying a self-consistent and over-constrained model that can explain the observations.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1812.06430,"Huiquan Li, Jiancheng Wang, ",Energy release from magnetospheres deformed by gravitational waves,"In this work, we consider the possibility of energy release in pulsar magnetospheres deformed by gravitational waves from nearby sources. The strong electromagnetic fields in the magnetospheres may release non-negligible energy despite the weakness of the gravitational wave. When the background spacetime is perturbed due to the passage of a gravitational wave, the original force-free state of the inner magnetosphere will be slightly violated. The plasma-filled magnetosphere tends to evolve into new force-free states as the spacetime varies with time. During this process, a small portion of the electromagnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere will be released to the acceleration of charged particles along the magnetic field lines. When the pulsar is close enough to the gravitational wave source (e.g., $\sim10^{-2}$ pc to the gravitational wave sources observed recently), the resulting energy loss rate is comparable with the radio luminosity of the pulsar. It is also noticed that, under very stringent conditions (for magnetars with much shorter distance to the sources), the released energy can reach the typical energy observed from fast radio bursts (FRBs).",astro-ph.HE

Current models predict that a significant amount of magnetic energy should be released prior to the merger, leading to electromagnetic precursor emission. In this paper, we revisit this problem in the light of the recent progress in kinetic modeling of pulsar magnetospheres. We limit our work to the case of aligned magnetic moments and rotation axes, and thus neglect the orbital motion. We perform global two-dimensional axisymmetric particle-in-cell simulations of two pulsar magnetospheres merging at a rate consistent with the emission of gravitational waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric systems are investigated. Simulations show a significant enhancement of magnetic dissipation within the magnetospheres as both stars get closer. Even though the magnetospheric configuration depends on the relative orientations of the pulsar spins and magnetic axes, all configurations present nearly the same radiative signature, indicating that a common dissipation mechanism is at work. The relative motion of both pulsars drives magnetic reconnection at the boundary between the two magnetospheres, leading to efficient particle acceleration and high-energy synchrotron emission. Polar-cap discharge is also strongly enhanced in asymmetric configurations, resulting in vigorous pair production and potentially additional high-energy radiation. We observe an increase in the pulsar radiative efficiency by two orders of magnitude over the last orbit before the merger exceeding the spindown power of an isolated pulsar. The expected signal is too weak to be detected at high energies even in the nearby universe. However, if a small fraction of this energy is channeled into radio waves, it could be observed as a non-repeating fast radio burst.",astro-ph.HE

Using a dimensionless quantity for the charge $q = Q/\sqrt{G}M$, our analyses infer that $q\sim O(10^{-4.5})$ can explain the FRBs with released energy of order $O(10^{40}) {\rm ergs}$. With the current sample of FRBs and assuming a distribution of charge $\phi(q)$ for all PBHs, we can deduce that its form is proportional to $q^{-3.0\pm0.1}$ for $q\geq 7.2\times10^{-5}$ if PBHs are sources of the observed FRBs. Furthermore, with the proposed hypothetical scenario and by estimating the local event rate of FRBs $\sim 2.6 \times 10^3 {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$, one derives a lower bound for the fraction of PBHs (at the mass of $10^{28}$g) against that of matter $f_{\rm PBH}(10^{28}{\rm g})$ $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ needed to explain the rate. With this inspiring estimate, we expect that future observations of FRBs can help to falsify their physical origins from the PBH binaries coalescences. In the future, the gravitational waves produced by mergers of small black holes can be detected by high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We believe that this work would be a useful addition to the current literature on multimessenger astronomy and cosmology.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1811.12714,"Jigisha V. Patel, Avinash A. Deshpande, ",The dynamic spectral signatures from Lunar Occultation: A simulation study,"Lunar occultation, which occurs when the Moon crosses sight-lines to distant sources, has been studied extensively through apparent intensity pattern resulting from Fresnel diffraction, and has been successfully used to measure angular sizes of extragalactic sources. However, such observations to-date have been mainly over narrow bandwidth, or averaged over the observing band, and the associated intensity pattern in time has rarely been examined in detail as a function of frequency over a wide band. Here, we revisit the phenomenon of lunar occultation with a view to study the associated intensity pattern as a function of both time and frequency. Through analytical and simulation approach, we examine the variation of intensity across the dynamic spectra, and look for chromatic signatures which could appear as discrete dispersed signal tracks, when the diffraction pattern is adequately smoothed by a finite source size. We particularly explore circumstances in which such diffraction pattern might closely follow the interstellar dispersion law followed by pulsars and transients, such as the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which remain a mystery even after a decade of their discovery. In this paper, we describe details of this investigation, relevant to radio frequencies at which FRBs have been detected, and discuss our findings, along with their implications. We also show how a band-averaged light curve suffers from temporal smearing, and consequent reduction in contrast of intensity variation, with increasing bandwidth. We suggest a way to recover the underlying diffraction signature, as well as the sensitivity improvement commensurate with usage of large bandwidths.",astro-ph.HE

The collision among the clumpy ejecta in the resulted jet could trigger plasma instability. As a result, the plasma in the jet will emit coherent curvature radiation. When the jet cone aims toward the observer, the apparent luminosity can be $10^{41}-10^{42}$\,erg/s. The duration of the resulted flare is $\sim$ millisecond.

The existence of such clumps are inferred from intervening quasar absorption systems, but have long been something of a theoretical mystery. We consider the implications for compact radio sources of the `fog-like' two-phase model of the circumgalactic medium recently proposed by McCourt et al.(2018). In this model, the CGM consists of a diffuse coronal gas ($T\gtrsim 10^6\,$K) in pressure equilibrium with numerous $\lesssim 1\,$pc scale cool clumps or `cloudlets' formed by shattering in a cooling instability. The areal filling factor of the cloudlets is expected to exceed unity in $\gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ haloes, and the ensuing radio-wave scattering is akin to that caused by turbulence in the Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM). If $30\,$per-cent of cosmic baryons are in the CGM, we show that for a cool-gas volume fraction of $f_{\rm v}\sim 10^{-3}$, sources at $z_{\rm s}\sim 1$ suffer angular broadening by $\sim 15\,\mu$as and temporal broadening by $\sim 1\,$ms at $\lambda = 30\,$cm, due to scattering by the clumps in intervening CGM. The former prediction will be difficult to test (the angular broadening will suppress Galactic scintillation only for $<10\,\mu$Jy compact synchrotron sources). However the latter prediction, of temporal broadening of localized fast radio bursts, can constrain the size and mass fraction of cool ionized gas clumps as function of halo mass and redshift, and thus provides a test of the model proposed by McCourt et al.(2018).",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:1811.10755,"J. I. Katz, ",FRB Energetics and Sources,"Repeating and apparently non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRB) differ by orders of magnitude in duty factors, energy and rotation measure. Extensive monitoring of apparently non-repeating FRB has failed to find any repetitions. This suggests the two types differ qualitatively, rather than in repetition rate, and are produced by distinct kinds of sources. The absence of periodicity in repeating FRB argues that they are not produced by neutron stars. They may originate in dilute relativistic jets produced by low luminosity black hole accretion. Non-repeating FRB may be produced by catastrophic events such as the collapse of an accreting magnetic neutron star to a black hole or of an accreting magnetic white dwarf to a neutron star, during which a disappearing magnetic moment radiates dipole radiation that accelerates electrons in nearby matter. If they are emitted by collimated beams of relativistic particles or charge ""bunches"" with Lorentz factor $\gamma$, their radiation is collimated into a solid angle $\sim \gamma^{-2}$ sterad, reducing the energy requirement. If powered by magnetic reconnection, a pulse of length $\Delta t$ may draw on the magnetic energy in a volume $\sim \gamma^4 (c \Delta t)^3$, although only a fraction $\sim 1/\gamma^2$ of this may be dissipated without decollimation.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1811.10748,J. W. T. Hessels et al.,FRB 121102 Bursts Show Complex Time-Frequency Structure,"FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we analyze a wide-frequency-range (1-8 GHz) sample of high-signal-to-noise, coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include sub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07 pc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the sub-bursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms sub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400 MHz, and a characteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher radio frequencies, the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the literature suggests an increase of Delta(DM) ~ 1-3 pc/cc in 4 years, though this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1811.10641,Nicola Locatelli et al.,The luminosity--volume test for cosmological Fast Radio Bursts,"We perform the luminosity--volume test, also known as $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$, to Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We compare the 23 FRBs, recently discovered by ASKAP, with 20 of the FRBs found by Parkes. These samples have different flux limits and correspond to different explored volumes. We assume that their dispersion measure indicates their redshift and apply the appropriate cosmological corrections to the spectrum and rate in order to compute the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ for the ASKAP and Parkes samples. For a radio spectrum of FRBs $F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1.6}$, we find $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle=0.66\pm 0.05$ for the ASKAP sample, that includes FRBs up to $z=0.7$, and 0.52$\pm 0.04$ for Parkes, that extends up to $z=2.1$. The ASKAP value suggests that the population of FRB progenitors evolves faster than the star formation rate, while the Parkes value is consistent with it. Even a delayed (as a power law or gaussian) star formation rate cannot reproduce the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ of both samples. If FRBs do not evolve in luminosity, the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ values of ASKAP and Parkes sample are consistent with a population of progenitors whose density strongly evolves with redshift as $\sim z^{2.8}$ up to $z \sim 0.7$.

Depending on the redshift distribution of FRBs and using the repeating FRB121102 as a model, we calculate a detection rate of multiply-imaged FRBs with their multiply-imaged hosts caused by the distribution of galaxy-cluster scale gravitational lenses of the order of $10^{-4}$ per square degree per year for a minimum total flux of the host of 10 $\mu$Jy at 1.4 GHz for SKA phase 2. Our comparison of estimated detection rates for quasars, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and FRBs shows that multiple images of FRBs could be more numerous than those of gamma ray bursts and supernovae and as numerous as multiple images of quasars. Time delays between the multiple images of an FRB break degeneracies in model-based and model-independent lens reconstructions as other time-varying sources do, yet without a microlensing bias as FRBs are more point-like and have shorter duration times. We estimate the relative imprecision of FRB time-delay measurements to be $10^{-10}$ for time delays on the order of 100 days for galaxy-cluster scale lenses, yielding more precise (local) lens properties than time delays from the other time-varying sources. Using the lens modelling software Grale, we show the increase in accuracy and precision of the reconstructed scaled surface mass density map of a simulated cluster-scale lens when adding time delays for one set of multiple images to the set of observational constraints.",astro-ph.CO

We examine propagation effects that could cause this suppression, and find that a low-frequency spectral cutoff may be generic regardless of the specific FRB emission mechanism. We then illustrate the effects of a low-frequency spectral cutoff on the statistics of FRBs, given a cosmological source population. The observed FRB rate peaks at a specific frequency under a variety of assumptions. Observations at lower frequencies are more sensitive to high-redshift events than observations above the maximal-rate frequency, and therefore result in more sharply broken fluence distributions.

arXiv:1810.13009,"Christopher Thompson, ",Impulsive Electromagnetic Emission near a Black Hole,"The electromagnetic signature of a point explosion near a Kerr black hole (BH) is evaluated. The first repetitions produced by gravitational lensing are not periodic in time; periodicity emerges only as the result of multiple circuits of the prograde and retrograde light rings and is accompanied by exponential dimming. Gravitational focusing creates a sequence of concentrated caustic features and biases the detection of a repeating source toward alignment of the BH spin with the plane of the sky. We consider the polarization pattern in the case of emission by the Lorentz upboosting and reflection of a magnetic field near the explosion site. Then the polarized fraction of the detected pulse approaches unity, and rays propagating near the equatorial plane maintain a consistent polarization direction. Near a slowly accreting supermassive BH (SMBH), additional repetitions are caused by reflection off annular fragments of an orbiting disk that has passed through an ionization instability. These results are applied to the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source 121102, giving a concrete and predictive example of how FRB detectability may be biased by lensing. A gravitational lensing delay of 10-30 s, and reflection delay up to $\sim 10^4$ s, are found for emission near the innermost stable circular orbit of a $3\times 10^5\,M_\odot$ SMBH; these effects combine to produce interesting correlations between delay time and burst fluence.

This is because the electric field responsible for accelerating the radiating particles becomes close to the quantum critical field strength and is then quickly shielded by Schwinger pairs within a nano-second. Future observations should be able to confirm this cut-off luminosity and hence provide a unique probe of the source location and magnetic field strength. We discuss how the maximum luminosity affects the observed flux distributions for repeating bursts from the same object and for the entire FRB population.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.10773,E. Petroff et al.,A fast radio burst with a low dispersion measure,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond pulses of radio emission of seemingly extragalactic origin. More than 50 FRBs have now been detected, with only one seen to repeat. Here we present a new FRB discovery, FRB 110214, which was detected in the high latitude portion of the High Time Resolution Universe South survey at the Parkes telescope. FRB 110214 has one of the lowest dispersion measures of any known FRB (DM = 168.9$\pm$0.5 pc cm$^{-3}$), and was detected in two beams of the Parkes multi-beam receiver. A triangulation of the burst origin on the sky identified three possible regions in the beam pattern where it may have originated, all in sidelobes of the primary detection beam. Depending on the true location of the burst the intrinsic fluence is estimated to fall in the range of 50 -- 2000 Jy ms, making FRB 110214 one of the highest-fluence FRBs detected with the Parkes telescope. No repeating pulses were seen in almost 100 hours of follow-up observations with the Parkes telescope down to a limiting fluence of 0.3 Jy ms for a 2-ms pulse. Similar low-DM, ultra-bright FRBs may be detected in telescope sidelobes in the future, making careful modeling of multi-beam instrument beam patterns of utmost importance for upcoming FRB surveys.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.09459,"Wenbin Lu, Pawan Kumar, Ramesh Narayan, ",Fast radio burst source properties from polarization measurements,"Recent polarization measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide new insights on these enigmatic sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear polarization and small variation of the polarization position angles (PAs) of multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted radiation travels through the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes too small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of the radiation mechanism or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss a number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs should follow the rotational period of the underlying neutron star (but the burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring this period will provide crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs. For FRB 121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination angle is less than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is outside the magnetic inclination cone. Other repeating FRBs may have a different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending on the magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.07270,"Aiichi Iwazaki, ",Explanation of Detailed Spectral Properties of FRBs by Axion Star Model,"We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast radio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars ( accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons coherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The radiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb the coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the time scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra of the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally broaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional to their center frequencies $\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies ( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler shifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On the other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center frequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift also makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter. Because the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger than those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating FRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields of the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs, which are over the extent of the receiver frequency range. The spectral features of the recently discovered new repeating FRB 180814.J0422+75 are coincident with our general analyses of the repeating FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.06353,Shotaro Yamasaki et al.,Relativistic Fireball Reprise: Radio Suppression at the Onset of Short Magnetar Bursts,"There is growing evidence that a clear distinction between magnetars and radio pulsars may not exist, implying the population of neutron stars that exhibit both radio pulsations and bursting activities could be potentially large. In this situation, new insights into the burst mechanism could be gained by combining the temporal behavior of radio pulsations. We present a general model for radio suppression by relativistic $e^{\pm}$ plasma outflows at the onset of magnetar flares. A sudden ejection of magnetic energy into the magnetosphere would generate a fireball plasma, which is promptly driven to expand at relativistic speed. This would make the plasma cutoff frequency significantly higher than the rest frame radio frequency, resulting in the suppression of radio waves. We analytically show that any GHz radio emission arising from the magnetosphere is suppressed for $\sim100\ {\rm s}$, depending on the total fireball energy. On the other hand, thermal radiation is expected from the hot spot(s) on the stellar surface created by an inflow of dense plasma, which could be the origin of short bursts. Since our hypothesis predicts radio suppression in coincidence with short bursts, this could be an indirect method to constrain the occurrence rate of short bursts at the faint end that remain undetected by X-ray detectors. Furthermore, ultra-fast gamma-ray flashes from the fireball photosphere is also expected as a smoking gun, although the onboard detection is challenging due to its extremely short duration $\sim\mu$s. Finally, our model is applied to the radio pulsar with magnetar-like activities, PSR J1119-6127 in light of recent observations. Implications for fast radio bursts and the possibility of plasma lensing are also discussed.",astro-ph.HE

This landscape will be changing rapidly with CHIME/FRB, recently commissioned in Canada, and HIRAX, under construction in South Africa. This is an opportune time to review existing theories and their observational consequences, allowing us to efficiently curtail viable astrophysical models as more data becomes available. In this article we provide a currently up to date catalogue of the numerous and varied theories proposed for Fast Radio Bursts so far.

We show how a young pulsar located at ~100 pc or more from an SR/FRB system could initiate the onset of a powerful burst of radiation detectable over cosmological distances. Our models using the OH$^2\Pi_{3/2}$ $\left(J=3/2\right)$ 1612 MHz and $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ $\left(J=5/2\right)$ 6030 MHz spectral lines match the light curves well and suggest the entanglement of more than $10^{30}$ initially inverted molecules over lengths of approximately 300 au for a single SR sample. SR also accounts for the observed temporal narrowing of FRB pulses with increasing frequency for FRB 121102, and predicts a scaling of the FRB spectral bandwidth with the frequency of observation, which we found to be consistent with the existing data.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04357,C. W. James et al.,The Slope of the Source-Count Distribution for Fast Radio Bursts,"The slope of the source-count distribution of fast radio burst (FRB) fluences, $\alpha$, has been estimated using a variety of methods. Hampering all attempts have been the low number of detected FRBs, and the difficulty of defining a completeness threshold for FRB surveys. In this work, we extend maximum-likelihood methods for estimating $\alpha$, using detected and threshold signal-to-noise ratios applied to all FRBs in a sample without regard to a completeness threshold. Using this method with FRBs detected by the Parkes radio telescope, we find $\alpha=-1.18 \pm 0.24$ (68\% confidence interval, C.I.), i.e.\ consistent with a non-evolving Euclidean distribution ($\alpha=-1.5$). Applying these methods to the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) FRB survey finds $\alpha=-2.2 \pm 0.47$ (68\% C.I.). A full maximum-likelihood estimate finds an inconsistency with the Parkes rate with a p-value of 0.86\% ($2.6\, \sigma$). If not due to statistical fluctuations or biases in Parkes data, this is the first evidence for deviations from a pure power law in the integral source-count distribution of FRBs. It is consistent with a steepening of the integral source-count distribution in the fluence range 5--40\,Jy\,ms, for instance due to a cosmological population of FRB progenitors evolving more rapidly than the star-formation rate, and peaking in the redshift range 1--3.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04356,C. W. James et al.,The Performance and Calibration of the CRAFT Fly's Eye Fast Radio Burst Survey,"Since January 2017, the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey (CRAFT) has been utilising commissioning antennas of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to survey for fast radio bursts (FRBs) in fly's eye mode. This is the first extensive astronomical survey using phased array feeds (PAFs), and a total of 20 FRBs have been reported. Here we present a calculation of the sensitivity and total exposure of this survey, using the pulsars B1641-45 (J1644-4559) and B0833-45 (J0835-4510, i.e.\ Vela) as calibrators. The design of the survey allows us to benchmark effects due to PAF beamshape, antenna-dependent system noise, radio-frequency interference, and fluctuations during commissioning on timescales from one hour to a year. Observation time, solid-angle, and search efficiency are calculated as a function of FRB fluence threshold. Using this metric, effective survey exposures and sensitivities are calculated as a function of the source counts distribution. The implied FRB rate is significantly lower than the $37$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ calculated using nominal exposures and sensitivities for this same sample by \citet{craft_nature}. At the Euclidean power-law index of $-1.5$, the rate is $10.7_{-1.8}^{+2.7}\,{\rm (sys)} \, \pm \, 3\,{\rm (stat)}$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above a threshold of $57\pm6\,{\rm (sys)}$\,Jy\,ms, while for the best-fit index for this sample of $-2.1$, it is $16.6_{-1.5}^{+1.9} \,{\rm (sys)}\, \pm 4.7\,{\rm (stat)}$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above a threshold of $41.6\pm1.5\,{\rm (sys)}$\,Jy\,ms. This strongly suggests that these calculations be performed for other FRB-hunting experiments, allowing meaningful comparisons to be made between them.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04355,M. Sokolowski et al.,No low-frequency emission from extremely bright Fast Radio Bursts,"We present the results of a coordinated campaign conducted with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to shadow Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 1.4 GHz, which resulted in simultaneous MWA observations of seven ASKAP FRBs. We de-dispersed the $24$ $\times$ $1.28$ MHz MWA images across the $170-200$ MHz band taken at 0.5 second time resolution at the known dispersion measures (DMs) and arrival times of the bursts and searched both within the ASKAP error regions (typically $\sim$ $10$ arcmin $\times$ $10$ arcmin), and beyond ($4$ deg $\times$ $4$ deg). We identified no candidates exceeding a $5\sigma$ threshold at these DMs in the dynamic spectra. These limits are inconsistent with the mean fluence scaling of $\alpha=-1.8 \pm 0.3$ (${\cal F}_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$, where $\nu$ is the observing frequency) that is reported for ASKAP events, most notably for the three high fluence (${\cal F}_{1.4\,{\rm GHz}} \gtrsim 100$ Jy ms) FRBs 171020, 180110 and 180324. Our limits show that pulse broadening alone cannot explain our non-detections, and that there must be a spectral turnover at frequencies above 200 MHz. We discuss and constrain parameters of three remaining plausible spectral break mechanisms: free-free absorption, intrinsic spectral turn-over of the radiative processes, and magnification of signals at ASKAP frequencies by caustics or scintillation. If free-free absorption were the cause of the spectral turnover, we constrain the thickness of the absorbing medium in terms of the electron temperature, $T$, to $< 0.03$ $(T/10^4 K)^{-1.35}$ pc for FRB 171020.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04354,Elizabeth K. Mahony et al.,A search for the host galaxy of FRB171020,"We report on a search for the host galaxy of FRB171020, the fast radio burst with the smallest recorded dispersion measure (DM $=114$ pc cm$^{-3}$) of our on-ongoing ASKAP survey. The low DM confines the burst location within a sufficiently small volume to rigorously constrain the identity of the host galaxy. We identify 16 candidate galaxies in the search volume and single out ESO 601-G036, a Sc galaxy at redshift $z=0.00867$, as the most likely host galaxy. UV and optical imaging and spectroscopy reveal this galaxy has a star-formation rate of approximately 0.1 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and oxygen abundance $12 + \log({\rm O/H}) = 8.3 \pm 0.2$, properties remarkably consistent with the galaxy hosting the repeating FRB121102. However, in contrast to FRB121102, follow-up radio observations of ESO 601-G036 show no compact radio emission above a 5$\sigma$ limit of $L_{2.1{\rm GHz}}=3.6\times 10^{19}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Using radio continuum observations of the field, combined with archival optical imaging data, we find no analog to the persistent radio source associated with FRB121102 within the localization region of FRB171020 out to $z=0.06$. These results suggest that FRBs are not necessarily associated with a luminous and compact radio continuum source.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04353,J. -P. Macquart et al.,The spectral properties of the bright FRB population,"We examine the spectra of 23 fast radio bursts detected in a fly's-eye survey with the Australian SKA Pathfinder, including those of three bursts not previously reported. The mean spectral index of $\alpha = -1.6_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$ ($F_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) is close to that of the Galactic pulsar population. The sample is dominated by bursts exhibiting a large degree of spectral modulation: 17 exhibit fine-scale spectral modulation with an rms exceeding 50% of the mean, with decorrelation bandwidths (half-maximum) ranging from $\approx$ to 49 MHz. Most decorrelation bandwidths are an order of magnitude lower than the $\gtrsim 30\,$MHz expected of Galactic interstellar scintillation at the Galactic latitude of the survey, $|b| = 50 \pm 5 \deg$. A test of the amplitude distribution of the spectral fluctuations reveals only 12 bursts consistent at better than a 5% confidence level with the prediction of 100%-modulated diffractive scintillation. Moreover, five of six FRBs with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 18 are consistent with this prediction at less than 1% confidence. Nonetheless, there is weak evidence (88-95% confidence) that the amplitude of the fine-scale spectral modulation is anti-correlated with dispersion measure (DM) that would suggest it originates as a propagation effect. This effect appears to be corroborated by the smoothness of the higher-DM Parkes FRBs, and could arise due to quenching of diffractive scintillation (e.g. in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy) by angular broadening in the intergalactic medium.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1810.04177,"Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos, Donald Lynden-Bell, ",Coupled axisymmetric pulsar magnetospheres,"We present solutions of force-free pulsar magnetospheres coupled with a uniform external magnetic field aligned with the dipole magnetic moment of the pulsar. The inclusion of the uniform magnetic field has the following consequences: The equatorial current sheet is truncated to a finite length, the fraction of field lines that are open increases, and the open field lines are confined within a cylindrical surface instead of becoming radial. A strong external magnetic field antiparallel to the dipole allows for solutions where the pulsar magnetic field is fully enclosed within an ellipsoidal surface. Configurations of fully enclosed or confined magnetospheres may appear in a double neutron star (DNS) where one of the components is a slowly rotating, strongly magnetised pulsar and the other a weakly magnetised millisecond pulsar. Depending on the geometry, twisted field lines from the millisecond pulsar could form an asymmetric wind. More dramatic consequences could appear closer to merger: there, the neutron star with the weaker magnetic field may undergo a stage where it alternates between an open and a fully enclosed magnetosphere releasing up $10^{38}$erg. Under favourable combinations of magnetic fields DNSs can spend up to 10$^3$ yr in the coupled phase, implying a Galactic population of $0.02$ systems. Potential observational signatures of this interaction are discussed including the possibility of powering recurring Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We also note that the magnetic interaction cannot have any significant effect on the spin evolution of the two pulsars.",astro-ph.HE

Because of electromagnetic interactions between the magnetospheres of the two compact stars, a substantial amount of energy will be extracted, and the resultant power is expected to be $\sim 10^{38} - 10^{44}$ erg/s in the last few seconds before the two stars merge, when the binary system contains a NS with a surface magnetic field $10^{12}$ G. The induced electric field in the process can accelerate charged particles up to the EeV energy range. Synchrotron radiation is emitted from energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary NSs and the MeV energy for NS - WD or double WD binaries. In addition, a blackbody component is also presented and it peaks at several to hundreds keV for binary NSs and at several keV for NS - WD or double WD binaries. The strong angular dependence of the synchrotron radiation and the isotropic nature of the blackbody radiation lead to distinguishable modulation patterns between the two emission components. If coherent curvature radiation is presented, fast radio bursts could be produced. These components provide unique simultaneous electromagnetic signatures as precursors of gravitational wave events associated with magnetized compact star mergers and short gamma ray bursts (e.g., GRB 100717).",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1809.10812,Dongzi Li et al.,Constraining small scale magnetic fields through plasma lensing: Application to the Black widow eclipsing pulsar binary,"In regions with strongly varying electron density, radio emission can be magnified significantly by plasma lensing. In the presence of magnetic fields, magnification in time and frequency will be different for two circular polarizations. We show how these effects can be used to measure or constrain the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight, $B_\parallel$, as well as its spatial structure, $\sigma_{B_\parallel}$, in the lensing region. In addition, we discuss how generalized Faraday rotation can constrain the strength of the perpendicular field, $B_\perp$. We attempt to make such measurements for the Black Widow pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, in which plasma lensing was recently discovered. For this system, pressure equilibrium suggests $B\gtrsim 20\,$G at the interface between the pulsar and companion winds, where the radio eclipse starts and ends, and where most lensing occurs. We find no evidence for large-scale magnetic fields, with, on average, $B_\parallel=0.02\pm0.09\,$G over the egress lensing region. From individual lensing events, we strongly constrain small scale magnetic structure to $\sigma_B<10\,$mG, thus excluding scenarios with a strong but rapidly varying field. Finally, from the lack of reduction of average circular polarization in the same region, we rule out a strong, quasi-transverse field. We cannot identify any plausible scenario in which a large magnetic field in this system is concealed, leaving the nature of the interface between the pulsar and companion winds an enigma. Our method can be applied to other sources showing plasma lensing, including other eclipsing pulsars and fast radio bursts, to study the local properties of the magnetic field.",astro-ph.HE

MuÃ±oz, Abraham Loeb, ",Finding the Missing Baryons with Fast Radio Bursts and Sunyaev-Zeldovich Maps,"Almost a third of the cosmic baryons are ""missing"" at low redshifts, as they reside in the invisible warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, which measures the line-of-sight integral of the plasma pressure, can potentially detect this WHIM, although its expected signal is hidden below the noise. Extragalactic dispersion measures (DMs)---obtained through observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs)---are excellent tracers of the WHIM, as they measure the column density of plasma, regardless of its temperature. Here we propose cross correlating DMs and tSZ maps as a new way to find and characterize the missing baryons in the WHIM. Our method relies on the precise ($\sim$ arcminute) angular localization of FRBs to assign each burst a DM and a $y$ parameter. We forecast that the signal from the WHIM should be confidently detected in a cross-correlation analysis of $\sim10^4$ FRBs, expected to be gathered in a year of operation of the upcoming CHIME and HIRAX radio arrays, confirming the recent tentative detections of filamentary WHIM. Using this technique, future CMB probes (which might lower the tSZ noise) could determine both the temperature of the WHIM and its evolution to within tens of percent. Altogether, DM-tSZ cross correlations hold great promise for studying the baryons in the local Universe.",astro-ph.CO

The new pulses were found with a convolutional neural network in data taken on August 26, 2017, where 21 bursts have been previously detected. Our technique combines neural network detection with dedispersion verification. For the current application we demonstrate its advantage over a traditional brute-force dedis- persion algorithm in terms of higher sensitivity, lower false positive rates, and faster computational speed. Together with the 21 previously reported pulses, this observa- tion marks the highest number of FRB 121102 pulses from a single observation, total- ing 93 pulses in five hours, including 45 pulses within the first 30 minutes. The number of data points reveal trends in pulse fluence, pulse detection rate, and pulse frequency structure. We introduce a new periodicity search technique, based on the Rayleigh test, to analyze the time of arrivals, with which we exclude with 99% confidence pe- riodicity in time of arrivals with periods larger than 5.1 times the model-dependent time-stamp uncertainty. In particular, we rule out constant periods >10 ms in the barycentric arrival times, though intrinsic periodicity in the time of emission remains plausible.",astro-ph.HE

We study the magnetar's radio profile shape, flux density, radio spectrum, and single pulse behavior over a ~1 year period between MJDs 57233 and 57621. In particular, the magnetar exhibits a significantly negative average spectral index of $\langle\alpha\rangle$ = -1.86 $\pm$ 0.02 when the 8.4 GHz profile is single-peaked, which flattens considerably when the profile is double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single pulses at 8.4 GHz on MJD 57479 and find that giant pulses and pulses with multiple emission components are emitted during a significant number of rotations. The resulting single pulse flux density distribution is incompatible with a log-normal distribution. The typical pulse width of the components is ~1.8 ms, and the prevailing delay time between successive components is ~7.7 ms. Many of the single pulse emission components show significant frequency structure over bandwidths of ~100 MHz, which we believe is the first observation of such behavior from a radio magnetar. We report a characteristic single pulse broadening timescale of $\langle\tau_{d}\rangle$ = 6.9 $\pm$ 0.2 ms at 8.4 GHz. We find that the pulse broadening is highly variable between emission components and cannot be explained by a thin scattering screen at distances $\gtrsim$ 1 kpc. We discuss possible intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for the magnetar's emission and compare our results to other magnetars, high magnetic field pulsars, and fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Their nature remains mysterious, motivating searches for counterparts at other wavelengths. FRB 121102 is so far the only source known to repeatedly emit FRBs and is associated with a host galaxy at redshift $z \simeq 0.193$. We conducted simultaneous observations of FRB 121102 with the Arecibo and MAGIC telescopes during several epochs in 2016--2017. This allowed searches for millisecond-timescale burst emission in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays as well as the optical band. While a total of five FRBs were detected during these observations, no VHE emission was detected, neither of a persistent nature nor burst-like associated with the FRBs. The average integral flux upper limits above 100 GeV at 95% confidence level are $6.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{photons\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ (corresponding to luminosity $L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim 10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the entire observation period, and $1.2 \times 10^{-7}~ \mathrm{photons\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim 10^{49}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the total duration of the five FRBs. We constrain the optical U-band flux to be below 8.6 mJy at 5-$\sigma$ level for 1-ms intervals around the FRB arrival times. A bright burst with U-band flux $29~\mathrm{mJy}$ and duration $\sim 12$ ms was detected 4.3 s before the arrival of one FRB. However, the probability of spuriously detecting such a signal within the sampled time space is 1.5% (2.2 $\sigma$, post-trial), i.e. consistent with the expected background.

The mission plans to launch two 30-m-diameter radio telescopes into 2,000 km x 90,000 km elliptical orbits. The two telescopes can work in flexibly diverse modes: (i) space-ground VLBI. The maximum space-ground baseline length is about 100,000 km; it provides a high-dynamic-range imaging capacity with unprecedented high resolutions at low frequencies (0.4 mas at 1.67 GHz and 20 mas at 30 MHz) enabling studies of exoplanets and supermassive black hole binaries (which emit nanoHz gravitational waves); (ii) space-space single-baseline VLBI. This unique baseline enables the detection of flaring hydroxyl masers, and more precise position measurement of pulsars and radio transients at milli-arcsecond level; (iii) single dish mode, where each telescope can be used to monitor transient bursts and rapidly trigger follow-up VLBI observations.

Broadband radio polarimetric data is essential to ensure the quality of Faraday tomography, but such data is not easy to obtain because of radio frequency interferences (RFIs). In this paper, we investigate optimum frequency coverage of Faraday tomography so as to explore Faraday rotation measure (RM) due to the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in filaments of galaxies. We adopt a simple model of the IGMF and estimate confidence intervals of the model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. We find that meaningful constraints for RM due to the IGMF are available with data at multiple narrowbands which are scattered over the ultra-high frequency (UHF, 300 MHz - 3000 MHz). The optimum frequency depends on the Faraday thickness of the Milky Way foreground. These results are obtained for a wide brightness range of the background source including fast radio bursts (FRBs).

It was proposed that FRB 121102 is powered by a young flaring magnetar, embedded within a decades-old supernova remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding magnetized electron-ion nebula (powered by the same outbursts likely responsible for the FRBs) can explain all the basic properties of the quiescent source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and the large but decreasing rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The quiescent emission is powered by relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar wind, while the RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier in the nebula's evolution and cooled through expansion and radiative losses. The model contains few free parameters, which are tightly constrained by observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history, $\sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond magnetar; the baryon loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent flares) is close to the neutron star escape speed; the predicted source age $\sim 10-40$ years is consistent with other constraints on the nebula size. For an energy input rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-\alpha}$ following the onset of magnetar activity, we predict secular decay of the RM and quiescent source flux, which approximately follow ${\rm RM} \propto t^{-(6+\alpha)/2}$ and $F_{\nu} \propto t^{-(\alpha^2+7\alpha-2)/4}$, respectively.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1808.09929,Rui Luo et al.,On the normalised FRB luminosity function,"Thirty-three fast radio bursts (FRBs) had been detected by March 2018. Although the sample size is still limited, meaningful statistical studies can already be carried out. The normalised luminosity function places important constraints on the intrinsic power output, sheds light on the origin(s) of FRBs, and can guide future observations. In this paper, we measure the normalised luminosity function of FRBs. Using Bayesian statistics, we can naturally account for a variety of factors such as receiver noise temperature, bandwidth, and source selection criteria. We can also include astronomical systematics, such as host galaxy dispersion measure, FRB local dispersion measure, galaxy evolution, geometric projection effects, and Galactic halo contribution. Assuming a Schechter luminosity function, we show that the isotropic luminosities of FRBs have a power-law distribution that covers approximately three orders of magnitude, with a power-law index ranging from $-1.8$ to $-1.2$ and a cut off $\sim 2\times 10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. By using different galaxy models and well-established Bayesian marginalisation techniques, we show that our conclusions are robust against unknowns, such as the electron densities in the Milky Way halo and the FRB environment, host galaxy morphology, and telescope beam response.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1808.09471,"Akshay Suresh, James M. Cordes, ",Induced Polarization from Birefringent Pulse Splitting in Magnetoionic Media,"Birefringence in ionized, magnetized media is usually measured as Faraday rotation of linearly polarized radiation. However, pulses propagating through regions with very large Faraday rotation measures (RMs) can split into circularly polarized components with measurable differences in arrival times $\propto \nu^{-3}\, \rm RM$, where $\nu$ is the radio frequency. Differential refraction from gradients in DM (dispersion measure) and RM can contribute a splitting time $\propto \vert \mathbf{\nabla_{\perp}} \rm DM \vert \vert \mathbf{\nabla_{\perp}}\rm RM \vert\,\nu^{-5}$. Regardless of whether the emitted pulse is unpolarized or linearly polarized, net circular polarization will be measured when splitting is a significant fraction of the pulse width. However, the initial polarization may be inferable from the noise statistics of the bursts. Extreme multipath scattering that broadens pulses can mask splitting effects. We discuss particular cases such as the Galactic center magnetar, J1749$-$2900, and the repeating fast radio burst source, FRB 121102. Both lines of sight have $\rm RM \sim 10^5~\rm rad~m^{-2}$ that yields millisecond splittings at frequencies well below $\sim 1 \text{ GHz}$. We also consider the splitting of nanosecond shot pulses in giant pulses from the Crab pulsar and the minimal effects of birefringence on precision pulsar timing. Finally, we explore the utility of two-dimensional coherent dedispersion with DM and RM as parameters.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1808.07809,Griffin Foster et al.,Verifying and Reporting Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a class of short-duration transients at radio wavelengths with inferred astrophysical origin. The prototypical FRB is a broadband signal that occurs over the extent of the receiver frequency range, is narrow in time, and is highly dispersed, following a $\nu^{-2}$ relation. However, some FRBs appear band-limited, and show apparent scintillation, complex frequency-dependent structure, or multi-component pulse shapes. While there is sufficient evidence that FRBs are indeed astrophysical, their one-off nature necessitates extra scrutiny when reporting a detection as bona fide and not a false positive. Currently, there is no formal validation framework for FRBs, rather a set of community practices. In this article, we discuss potential sources of false positives, and suggest a framework in which FRB-like events can be evaluated as real or otherwise. We present examples of false-positive events in data from the Arecibo, LOFAR, and Nanshan telescopes, which while FRB-like, are found to be due to instrumental variations, noise, and radio-frequency interference. Differentiating these false-positive detections from astrophysical events requires knowledge and tests beyond thresholded single-pulse detection. We discuss post-detection analyses, verification tests, and datasets which should be provided when reporting an FRB detection.",astro-ph.IM

We confirm that the scattering by the clumpy IGM has significant line-of-sight variations. We demonstrate that the scattering by the IGM in the voids and walls of the cosmic web is weak, but it can be significantly enhanced by the gas in clusters and filaments. The observed non-monotonic dependence of the FRB widths on the dispersion measures (DM) cannot determine whether the IGM is an important scattering matter or not. The IGM may dominate the scattering of some FRBs, and the host galaxy dominates others. For the former case, the scattering should be primarily caused by the medium in clusters. A mock sample of 500 sources shows that $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \propto \rm{DM_{IGM}}^{1.6-2.1}$ at $z<1.5$. Assuming that the turbulence follows Kolmogorov scaling, we find that an outer scale of $L_0\sim 5\,$pc is required to make $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \sim 1-10\,$ms at $\nu=1\, $ GHz. The required $L_0\sim 5\, $pc can alleviate the tension in the timescales of turbulent heating and cooling but is still $\sim 4$ orders of magnitude lower than the presumed injection scale of turbulence in the IGM. The gap is expected to be effectively shortened if the simulation resolution is further increased. The mechanisms that may further reduce the gap are shortly discussed. If future observations can justify the role of the IGM in the broadening of FRBs, it can help to probe the gas in clusters and filaments.",astro-ph.CO

Michilli et al.,Single-pulse classifier for the LOFAR Tied-Array All-sky Survey,"Searches for millisecond-duration, dispersed single pulses have become a standard tool used during radio pulsar surveys in the last decade. They have enabled the discovery of two new classes of sources: rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts. However, we are now in a regime where the sensitivity to single pulses in radio surveys is often limited more by the strong background of radio frequency interference (RFI, which can greatly increase the false-positive rate) than by the sensitivity of the telescope itself. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the Single-pulse Searcher (SpS). This is a new machine-learning classifier designed to identify astrophysical signals in a strong RFI environment, and optimized to process the large data volumes produced by the new generation of aperture array telescopes. It has been specifically developed for the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), an ongoing survey for pulsars and fast radio transients in the northern hemisphere. During its development, SpS discovered 7 new pulsars and blindly identified ~80 known sources. The modular design of the software offers the possibility to easily adapt it to other studies with different instruments and characteristics. Indeed, SpS has already been used in other projects, e.g. to identify pulses from the fast radio burst source FRB 121102. The software development is complete and SpS is now being used to re-process all LOTAAS data collected to date.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1808.04822,"Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz, ",Are fast radio bursts the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of neutron star mergers resulting in prompt collapse?,"Inspiraling and merging binary neutron stars (BNSs) are important sources of both gravitational waves and coincident electromagnetic counterparts. If the BNS total mass is larger than a threshold value, a black hole ensues promptly after merger. Through a statistical study in conjunction with recent LIGO/Virgo constraints on the nuclear equation of state, we estimate that up to $\sim 25\%$ of BNS mergers may result in prompt collapse. Moreover, we find that most models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of prompt-collapse BNS mergers have $q\gtrsim 0.8$. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers with mass ratio $q \gtrsim 0.8$ may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such BNS mergers ""orphan"". However, recent studies have found that ${10^{41-43}(B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2 erg\, s^{-1}}$ electromagnetic signals can be powered by magnetospheric interactions several milliseconds prior to merger. Moreover, the energy stored in the magnetosphere of an orphan BNS merger remnant will be radiated away in ${\mathcal O}(1\ \rm ms)$. Through simulations in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black hole formation is $E_B \sim 10^{39-41} (B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2$ erg. Radiating $\sim 1\%$ of $E_B$ in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). These results combined with our statistical study suggest that a non-repeating FRB may be the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of prompt-collapse BNSs.",astro-ph.HE

Fluctuations in the axion field give rise to stable localised overdensities known as axion stars, which, for the most massive, compact cases, are potential neutron star mimickers. In principle, there are no fundamental arguments against the multi-messenger observations of GW170817/GRB170817A/AT2017gfo arising from the merger of a neutron star with a neutron star mimicker, rather than from a binary neutron star. To constrain this possibility and better understand the astrophysical signatures of a neutron star--axion star (NSAS) merger, we present in this work a detailed example case of a NSAS merger based on full 3D numerical relativity simulations, and give an overview of the many potential observables - ranging from gravitational waves, to optical and near-infrared electromagnetic signals, radio flares, fast radio bursts, gamma ray bursts, and neutrino emission. We discuss the individual channels and estimate to which distances current and future observatories might be able to detect such a NSAS merger. Such signals could constrain the unknown axion mass and its couplings to standard baryonic matter,thus enhancing our understanding of the dark matter sector of the Universe.",astro-ph.HE

We have conducted a sensitivity analysis of this new pipeline in which multiple single pulses with a wide range of parameters were injected into PALFA data sets and run through the pipeline. Based on the recovered pulses, we find that for pulse widths $\rm < 5\ ms$ the sensitivity of the PALFA pipeline is at most a factor of $\rm \sim 2$ less sensitive to single pulses than our theoretical predictions. For pulse widths $\rm > 10\ ms$, as the $\rm DM$ decreases, the degradation in sensitivity gets worse and can increase up to a factor of $\rm \sim 4.5$. Using this pipeline, we have thus far discovered 7 pulsars and 2 RRATs and identified 3 candidate RRATs and 1 candidate FRB. The confirmed pulsars and RRATs have DMs ranging from 133 to 386 pc cm$^{-3}$ and flux densities ranging from 20 to 160 mJy. The pulsar periods range from 0.4 to 2.1 s. We report on candidate FRB 141113, which we argue is likely astrophysical and extragalactic, having $\rm DM \simeq 400\ pc~cm^{-3}$, which represents an excess over the Galactic maximum along this line of sight of $\rm \sim$ 100 - 200 pc cm$^{-3}$. We consider implications for the FRB population and show via simulations that if FRB 141113 is real and extragalactic, the slope $\alpha$ of the distribution of integral source counts as a function of flux density ($N (>S) \propto S^{-\alpha}$) is $1.4 \pm 0.5$ (95% confidence range).

Several theoretical models expect that the FRB accompanies an optical afterglow (e.g., Totani 2013; Kashiyama et al. 2013). In order to investigate the origin of FRBs, we perform $gri$-band follow-up observations of FRB~151230 (estimated $z \lesssim 0.8$) with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam at $8$, $11$, and $14$~days after discovery. The follow-up observation reaches a $50\%$ completeness magnitude of $26.5$~mag for point sources, which is the deepest optical follow-up of FRBs to date. We find $13$ counterpart candidates with variabilities during the observation. We investigate their properties with multicolor and multi-wavelength observations and archival catalogs. Two candidates are excluded by the non-detection of FRB~151230 in the other radio feed horns that operated simultaneously to the detection, as well as the inconsistency between the photometric redshift and that derived from the dispersion measure of FRB~151230. Eight further candidates are consistent with optical variability seen in AGNs. Two more candidates are well fitted with transient templates (Type IIn supernovae), and the final candidate is poorly fitted with all of our transient templates and is located off-center of an extended source. It can only be reproduced with rapid transients with a faint peak and rapid decline and the probability of chance coincidence is $\sim3.6\%$. We also find that none of our candidates are consistent with Type Ia supernovae, which rules out the association of Type Ia supernovae to FRB~151230 at $z\leq0.6$ and limits the dispersion measure of the host galaxy to $\lesssim300$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ in a Type Ia supernova scenario.",astro-ph.HE

Chengalur, Ue-Li Pen, ",Post-correlation beamformer for time-domain studies of pulsars and transients,"We present a detailed analysis of post-correlation beamforming (i.e. beamforming which involves only phased sums of the correlation of the voltages of different antennas in an array), and compare it with the traditionally used incoherent and phased beamforming techniques. Using data from the GMRT we show that post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the signal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of magnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events like fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the post-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency interference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than the incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of post-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam from the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The computational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their suitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed here would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays. Finally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the post-correlation beamformation as a case study. We find that post-correlation beamforming will improve the current GMRT time-domain survey sensitivity by ~ 2 times for pulsars with periods of few 100s of millisecond and by many-folds for even slower pulsars, making it one of the most sensitive surveys for pulsars and FRBs at low and mid radio frequencies.",astro-ph.IM

We analyse the flux density and fluence distributions of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a tool to investigate their luminosity distance distribution and the evolution of their prevalence throughout cosmic history. We examine in detail particular scenarios in which the burst population follows some power of the cosmic star formation rate. FRBs present an important additional measurable over source counts of existing cosmological populations, namely the dispersion measure. Based on the known redshift of FRB121102 (the repeater) we expect at least 50% of the dispersion measure to be attributable to the inter-galactic medium and hence it can be used as a proxy for distance. We develop the framework to interpret the dispersion measure distribution, and investigate how the effect of Helium reionization in the intergalactic medium is evident in this distribution. Examination of existing data suggests that the FRB luminosity function is flatter than a critical slope, making FRBs easily detectable to large distances; in this regime the reduction in flux density with distance is outweighed by the increase in the number of bright bursts within the search volume.",astro-ph.HE

Albert et al.,Search for high-energy neutrinos in coincidence with Fast Radio Bursts with the ANTARES neutrino telescope,"In the past decade, a new class of bright transient radio sources with millisecond duration has been discovered. The origin of these so-called Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is still a great mystery despite the growing observational efforts made by various multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities. So far, many models have been proposed to explain FRBs but neither the progenitors nor the radiative and the particle acceleration processes at work have been clearly identified. In this paper, the question whether some hadronic processes may occur in the vicinity of the FRB source is assessed. If so, FRBs may contribute to the high energy cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes. A search for these hadronic signatures has been done using the ANTARES neutrino telescope. The analysis consists in looking for high-energy neutrinos, in the TeV-PeV regime, spatially and temporally coincident with the detected FRBs. Most of the FRBs discovered in the period 2013-2017 were in the field of view of the ANTARES detector, which is sensitive mostly to events originating from the Southern hemisphere. From this period, 12 FRBs have been selected and no coincident neutrino candidate was observed. Upper limits on the per burst neutrino fluence have been derived using a power law spectrum, $\rm{\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\propto E_\nu^{-\gamma}}$, for the incoming neutrino flux, assuming spectral indexes $\gamma$ = 1.0, 2.0, 2.5. Finally, the neutrino energy has been constrained by computing the total energy radiated in neutrinos assuming different distances for the FRBs. Constraints on the neutrino fluence and on the energy released are derived from the associated null results.",astro-ph.HE

Here we present three bursts detected with the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope at 4.85 GHz. All three bursts exhibited frequency structure on broad and narrow frequency scales. Using an autocorrelation function analysis, we measured a characteristic bandwidth of the small-scale structure of 6.4$\pm$1.6 MHz, which is consistent with the diffractive scintillation bandwidth for this line of sight through the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) predicted by the NE2001 model. These were the only detections in a campaign totaling 22 hours in 10 observing epochs spanning five months. The observed burst detection rate within this observation was inconsistent with a Poisson process with a constant average occurrence rate; three bursts arrived in the final 0.3 hr of a 2 hr observation on 2016 August 20. We therefore observed a change in the rate of detectable bursts during this observation, and we argue that boosting by diffractive interstellar scintillations may have played a role in the detectability. Understanding whether changes in the detection rate of bursts from FRB 121102 observed at other radio frequencies and epochs are also a product of propagation effects, such as scintillation boosting by the Galactic ISM or plasma lensing in the host galaxy, or an intrinsic property of the burst emission will require further observations.",astro-ph.HE

However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on $\sim 100 \, {\rm yr}$ timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh. In terms of radio transparency and dispersion measure constraints, the repeating FRB 121102 is consistent with originating from a young, $\gtrsim 30-100 \, {\rm yr}$, magnetar similar to those inferred to power SLSNe. We further show that its high rotation measure can be produced within the same nebula that is proposed to power the quiescent radio source observed co-located with FRB 121102.

Moreover, unlike the traditional standard-siren approach (i.e., the $D_{L}$ method) and the $\rm DM_{IGM}$ method that rely on the optimization of the Hubble constant $H_0$, this $D_{L}\cdot{\rm DM_{IGM}}$ method has the advantage of being independent of $H_0$. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we prove that the $D_{L}\cdot{\rm DM_{IGM}}$ method is more effective to constrain cosmological parameters than $D_{L}$ or ${\rm DM_{IGM}}$ separately, and enables us to achieve accurate multimessenger cosmology from around 100 GW/FRB systems. Additionally, even if GW/FRB associations are not exist, the methodology developed here can still be applied to those GWs and FRBs that occur at the same redshifts.",astro-ph.CO

Vazza et al.,Probing the origin of extragalactic magnetic fields with Fast Radio Bursts,"The joint analysis of the Dispersion and Faraday Rotation Measure from distant, polarised Fast Radio Bursts may be used to put constraints on the origin and distribution of extragalactic magnetic fields on cosmological scales. While the combination of Dispersion and Faraday Rotation Measure can in principle give the average magnetic fields along the line-of-sight, in practice this method must be used with care because it strongly depends on the assumed magnetisation model on large cosmological scales. Our simulations show that the observation of Rotation Measures with $\geq 1-10 ~\rm rad/m^2$ in $\sim 10^2$ Fast Radio Bursts will be able to discriminate between extreme scenarios for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields, independent of the exact distribution of sources with redshift.

arXiv:1805.09348,Robert Main et al.,Pulsar emission amplified and resolved by plasma lensing in an eclipsing binary,"Radio pulsars scintillate because their emission travels through the ionized interstellar medium via multiple paths, which interfere with each other. It has long been realized that the scattering screens responsible for the scintillation could be used as `interstellar lenses' to localize pulsar emission regions. Most scattering screens, however, only marginally resolve emission components, limiting results to statistical inferences and detections of small positional shifts. Since screens situated close to the source have better resolution, it should be easier to resolve emission regions of pulsars located in high density environments such as supernova remnants or binaries in which the pulsar's companion has an ionized outflow. Here, we report events of extreme plasma lensing in the `Black Widow' pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, near the phase in its 9.2 hour orbit in which its emission is eclipsed by its companion's outflow. During the lensing events, the flux is enhanced by factors of up to 70--80 at specific frequencies. The strongest events clearly resolve the emission regions: they affect the narrow main pulse and parts of the wider interpulse differently. We show that the events arise naturally from density fluctuations in the outer regions of the outflow, and infer a resolution of our lenses comparable to the pulsar's radius, about 10\,km. Furthermore, the distinct frequency structures imparted by the lensing are reminiscent of what is observed for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102, providing observational support for the idea that this source is observed through, and thus at times strongly magnified by, plasma lenses.",astro-ph.HE

Numerous models have been proposed in order to explain these powerful and brief outbursts but none of them is commonly accepted, it is not clear which of these scenarios might account for real FRB.

Strange stars, which are composed of almost equal numbers of u, d, and s quarks, may be encapsulated by a thin crust of normal hadronic matter. When a strange star accretes matter from its environment, the crust becomes heavier and heavier. It may finally collapse, leading to the release of a large amount of magnetic energy and plenty of electron/positron pairs on a very short timescale. Electron/positron pairs in the polar cap region of the strange star can be accelerated to relativistic velocities, streaming along the magnetic field lines to form a thin shell. FRBs are produced by coherent emission from these electrons when the shell is expanding. Basic characteristics of observed FRBs can be explained in our model.",astro-ph.HE

We examine possible progenitor models for FRB 160102 in extragalactic, non-cosmological and cosmological scenarios. After accounting for the Galactic foreground contribution, we estimate the intrinsic RM to be -256(9) rad m$^{-2}$ in the low-redshift case and $\sim 2.4 \times 10^{2}$ rad m$^{-2}$ in the high-redshift case. We assess the relative likeliness of these scenarios and how each can be tested.

We demonstrate that the dispersion measures (DMs) of samples of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the distribution of baryons between the CGM and IGM. We propose to separate the CGM and IGM contributions to FRB DMs by including redshift and mass measurements of intervening galaxies. Using simulated samples of FRB sightlines through intervening galaxy halos and an illustrative model for the CGM, and including realistic observational uncertainties, we show that small samples ($O(10^{1})-O(10^{2})$) of localized FRBs are sensitive to the presence of CGM gas. The fractions of baryons in the CGM and IGM can be accurately estimated with 100 FRBs at $z<1$, and the characteristic radial density profiles of CGM halos may also be possible to constrain.

arXiv:1804.06149,"J. W. T. Hessels, ",Fast Radio Bursts and their Possible Neutron Star Origins,"The discovery of the `Lorimer Burst', a little over a decade ago, ignited renewed interest in searching for short-duration radio transients. This event is now considered to be the first established Fast Radio Burst (FRB), which is a class of millisecond-duration radio transients. The large dispersive delays observed in FRBs distinguish them from the individual bright pulses from Galactic pulsars, and suggests that they originate deep in extragalactic space. Amazingly, FRBs are not rare: the implied event rate ranges up to many thousands of events per sky, per day. The fact that only two dozen FRBs have been discovered to date is a consequence of the limited sensitivity and field of view of current radio telescopes. The precise localization of FRB 121102, the first and currently only FRB observed to repeat, has led to the unambiguous identification of its host galaxy and thus proven its extragalactic origin and large energy scale. It remains unclear, however, whether all FRBs are capable of repeating (many appear far less active) or whether FRB 121102 implies that there are multiple sub-classes. Regardless, the repetitive nature of FRB 121102 and its localization to within a star-forming region in the host galaxy imply that the bursts might originate from an exceptionally powerful neutron star - one necessarily quite unlike any we have observed in the Milky Way. In these proceedings, I give a very brief introduction to the FRB phenomenon and focus primarily on the insights that FRB 121102 has provided thus far.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1804.04722,Calvin Leung et al.,Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle using Optical and Near-Infrared Crab Pulses,"The Weak Equivalence Principle states that the geodesics of a test particle in a gravitational field are independent of the particle's constitution. To constrain violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle, we use the one-meter telescope at Table Mountain Observatory near Los Angeles to monitor the relative arrival times of pulses from the Crab Pulsar in the optical ($\lambda \approx 585$ nm) and near-infrared ($\lambda \approx 814$ nm) using an instrument which detects single photons with nanosecond-timing resolution in those two bands. The infrared pulse arrives slightly before the visible pulse. Our three analysis methods give delays with statistical errors of $\Delta t_{obs} = 7.41 \pm 0.58$, $0.4 \pm 3.6$, and $7.35 \pm 4.48$ microseconds (at most 1/4000 of the pulsar period). We attribute this discrepancy to systematic error from the fact that the visible and infrared pulses have slightly different shapes. Whether this delay emerges from the pulsar, is caused by passing through wavelength-dependent media, or is caused by a violation of the equivalence principle, unless there is a fine-tuned cancellation among these, we set the first upper limit on the differential post-Newtonian parameter at these wavelengths of $\Delta \gamma < 1.07 \times 10^{-10}~(3\sigma)$. This result falls in an unexplored region of parameter space and complements existing limits on equivalence-principle violation from fast radio bursts, gamma ray bursts, as well as previous limits from the Crab.",astro-ph.HE

Observations were performed using the 4$-$8 GHz receiver of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with the Breakthrough Listen digital backend. We present the spectral, temporal and polarization properties of 21 bursts detected within the first 60 minutes of a total 6-hour observations. These observations comprise the highest burst density yet reported in the literature, with 18 bursts being detected in the first 30 minutes. A few bursts clearly show temporal sub-structures with distinct spectral properties. These sub-structures superimpose to provide enhanced peak signal-to-noise ratio at higher trial dispersion measures. Broad features occur in $\sim 1$ GHz wide subbands that typically differ in peak frequency between bursts within the band. Finer-scale structures ($\sim 10-50$ MHz) within these bursts are consistent with that expected from Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation. The bursts exhibit nearly 100% linear polarization, and a large average rotation measure of 9.359$\pm$0.012 $\times$ 10$^{\rm 4}$ rad m$^{\rm -2}$ (in the observer's frame). No circular polarization was found for any burst. We measure an approximately constant polarization position angle in the 13 brightest bursts.

Events potentially less useful for astronomical and cosmological purposes due to limited localisation will accumulate with the advent of new facilities and continued efforts by, e.g., the SUPERB collaboration, which may require afterglows or multi-wavelength counterparts for sub-arcsecond localisation. It is important to exploit these sources to their maximum scientific potential. We perform analysis of FRB dispersion measures (DMs), considering different theoretical FRB progenitors with view to place more rigorous constraints on FRB redshifts, in particular for large statistical samples, via their DMs. We review FRB DM components, and build redshift-scalable probability distributions corresponding to different progenitor scenarios. We combine these components into a framework for obtaining FRB DM probabilities given their redshifts. Taking into account different possibilities for the evolution of progenitors across cosmic time we invert this model, thus deriving redshift constraints. Effects of varying FRB progenitor models are illustrated. While, as expected, host galaxy DM contributions become decreasingly important with increasing redshift, for AGN-like progenitor scenarios they could remain significant out to redshift 3. Constraints are placed on redshifts of catalogued FRBs with various models and increasingly realistic models may be employed as general understanding of FRBs improves. For localised FRBs, we highlight future prospects for disentangling host and intergalactic medium DM components using their respective redshift scaling. We identify a use for large samples of unlocalised FRBs resulting from upcoming flux-limited surveys, such as with CHIME, in mapping out the Milky Way contribution to the DM.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1804.01104,"Anthony L. Piro, B. M. Gaensler, ",Dispersion and Rotation Measure of Supernova Remnants and Magnetized Stellar Winds: Application to Fast Radio Bursts,"Recent studies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have led to many theories associating them with young neutron stars. If this is the case, then the presence of supernova ejecta and stellar winds provide a changing dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can potentially be probes of the environments of FRB progenitors. Here we summarize the scalings for the DM and RM in the cases of a constant density ambient medium and of a progenitor stellar wind. Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the dynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in previous simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction. Furthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant sweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is not ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts. The combined DM and RM measurements for the repeating FRB 121102 are consistent with supernova ejecta with an age of $\sim10^2-10^3\,{\rm yrs}$ expanding into a high density ($\sim100\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium. This naturally explains its relatively constant DM over many years as well. Other FRBs with much lower RMs may indicate that they are especially young supernovae in wind environments or that their DMs are largely from the intergalactic medium. We therefore caution about inferring magnetic fields from simply by dividing an RM by DM, because these quantities could originate from distinct regions along the path an FRB propagates.",astro-ph.HE

To date, only one (FRB 121102) out of several dozen has been seen to repeat, though the extent to which it is exceptional remains unclear. We discuss detecting repetition from FRBs, which will be very important for understanding their physical origin, and which also allows for host galaxy localisation. We show how the combination of instrument sensitivity, beamshapes, and individual FRB luminosity functions affect the detection of sources whose repetition is not necessarily described by a homogeneous Poisson process. We demonstrate that the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) could detect many new repeating FRBs for which host galaxies could be subsequently localised using other interferometers, but it will not be an ideal instrument for monitoring FRB 121102. If the luminosity distributions of repeating FRBs are given by power-laws with significantly more dim than bright bursts, CHIME's repetition discoveries could preferentially come not from its own discoveries, but from sources first detected with lower-sensitivity instruments like the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in fly's eye mode. We then discuss observing strategies for upcoming surveys, and advocate following up sources at approximately regular intervalsand with telescopes of higher sensitivity, when possible. Finally, we discuss doing pulsar-like periodicity searching on FRB follow-up data, based on the idea that while most pulses are undetectable, folding on an underlying rotation period could reveal the hidden signal.",astro-ph.HE

Their origins are still largely uncertain. Here we suggest a new model for FRBs. We argue that the collision of a white dwarf with a black hole can give birth to a transient accretion disk, from which powerful episodic magnetic blobs will be launched. The collision between two consecutive magnetic blobs can result in a catastrophic magnetic reconnection, which releases a large amount of free magnetic energy and forms a forward shock. The shock propagates through the cold magnetized plasma within the blob in the collision region, radiating through synchrotron maser mechanism, which is responsible for a non-repeating FRB signal. Our calculations show that the theoretical energetics, radiation frequency, duration timescale, and event rate can be well consistent with the observational characteristic of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

However, the search for a rest mass of the photon has been hindered by the similarity between the frequency-dependent dispersions due to the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects. Considering the contributions to the observed dispersion measure from both the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects, and assuming the dispersion induced by the plasma effect is an unknown constant, we obtain a robust limit on the photon mass by directly fitting a combination of the dispersion measures of radio sources. Using the observed dispersion measures from two statistical samples of extragalactic pulsars, here we show that at the 68\% confidence level, the constraints on the photon mass can be as low as $m_{\gamma}\leq1.51\times10^{-48}~\rm kg\simeq8.47\times10^{-13}~{\rm eV}/c^{2}$ for the sample of 22 radio pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and $m_{\gamma}\leq1.58\times10^{-48}~\rm kg\simeq8.86\times10^{-13} {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ for the other sample of 5 radio pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which are comparable with that obtained by a single extragalactic pulsar.

We test these models by fitting the observational distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where, as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy function index $1.2\lesssim\gamma\lesssim1.7$, where a tentative fixed spectral index $\beta=0.8$ is adopted for all FRBs. Correspondingly, the local event rate of FRBs is constrained to $(3-6)\times10^4f_{\rm b}^{-1}(\mathcal T/270\rm s)^{-1}(\mathcal A/2\pi)^{-1}\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for an adopted minimum FRB energy of $E_{\min}=3\times10^{39}$ erg, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the beaming factor of the radiation, $\mathcal T$ is the duration of each pointing observation, and $\mathcal A $ is the sky area of the survey. This event rate, about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers, indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD binaries.",astro-ph.HE

In outburst, in fact, a magnetar can be brighter in X-rays by orders of magnitude and usually emit powerful bursts of hard-X/soft-gamma-ray photons that can be detected almost everywhere in the Galaxy with all-sky monitors such as those on board the Fermi satellite or the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Magnetars command great attention because the large progress that has been made in their understanding is proving fundamental to fathom the whole population of isolated neutron stars, and because, due to their extreme properties, they are relevant for a vast range of different astrophysical topics, from the study of gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae, to ultraluminous X-ray sources, fast radio bursts, and even to sources of gravitational waves.

The FRB discovery was accompanied by the capture of voltage data at the native time and frequency resolution of the observing system, enabling coherent dedispersion and detailed off-line analysis, which have unveiled fine temporal and frequency structure. The dispersion measure (DM) of 176.80 $\pm$ 0.04 pc cm$^{-3}$, is the lowest of the FRB population.

Commissioning observations of calibrator radio sources show that this receiver has the lowest reported beamformed system temperature ($T_{\rm sys}$) normalized by aperture efficiency ($\eta$) of any phased array receiver to date. The measured $T_{\rm sys}/\eta$ is $25.4 \pm 2.5$ K near 1350 MHz for the boresight beam, which is comparable to the performance of the current 1.4 GHz cryogenic single feed receiver on the GBT. The degradation in $T_{\rm sys}/\eta$ at $\sim$ 4 arcmin (required for Nyquist sampling) and $\sim$ 8 arcmin offsets from the boresight is, respectively, $\sim$ 1\% and $\sim$ 20\% of the boresight value. The survey speed of the PAF with seven formed beams is larger by a factor between 2.1 and 7 compared to a single beam system depending on the observing application. The measured performance, both in frequency and offset from boresight, qualitatively agree with predictions from a rigorous electromagnetic model of the PAF. The astronomical utility of the receiver is demonstrated by observations of the pulsar B0329+54 and an extended HII region, the Rosette Nebula. The enhanced survey speed with the new PAF receiver will enable the GBT to carry out exciting new science, such as more efficient observations of diffuse, extended neutral hydrogen emission from galactic in-flows and searches for Fast Radio Bursts.",astro-ph.IM

The abundance of false positives presents an intractable problem if candidates are to be inspected by eye, making it a good application for artificial intelligence (AI). We apply deep learning to single pulse classification and develop a hierarchical framework for ranking events by their probability of being true astrophysical transients. We construct a tree-like deep neural network (DNN) that takes multiple or individual data products as input (e.g. dynamic spectra and multi-beam detection information) and trains on them simultaneously. We have built training and test sets using false-positive triggers from real telescopes, along with simulated FRBs, and single pulses from pulsars. Training of the DNN was independently done for two radio telescopes: the CHIME Pathfinder, and Apertif on Westerbork. High accuracy and recall can be achieved with a labelled training set of a few thousand events. Even with high triggering rates, classification can be done very quickly on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). That speed is essential for selective voltage dumps or issuing real-time VOEvents. Next, we investigate whether dedispersion back-ends could be completely replaced by a real-time DNN classifier. It is shown that a single forward propagation through a moderate convolutional network could be faster than brute-force dedispersion; but the low signal-to-noise per pixel makes such a classifier sub-optimal for this problem. Real-time automated classification may prove useful for bright, unexpected signals, both now and in the era of radio astronomy when data volumes and the searchable parameter spaces further outgrow our ability to manually inspect the data, such as for SKA and ngVLA.",astro-ph.IM

Eftekhari et al.,Associating Fast Radio Bursts with Extragalactic Radio Sources: General Methodology and a Search for a Counterpart to FRB 170107,"The discovery of a repeating fast radio burst has led to the first precise localization, an association with a dwarf galaxy, and the identification of a coincident persistent radio source. However, further localizations are required to determine the nature of FRBs, the sources powering them, and the possibility of multiple populations. Here we investigate the use of associated persistent radio sources to establish FRB counterparts, taking into account the localization area and the persistent source flux density. Due to the lower areal number density of radio sources compared to faint optical sources, robust associations can be achieved for less precise localizations as compared to direct optical host galaxy associations. For generally larger localizations which preclude robust associations, the number of candidate hosts can be reduced based on the ratio of radio-to-optical brightness. We find that confident associations with $\sim 0.01-$1 mJy sources, comparable to the luminosity of the persistent source associated with FRB 121102 over the redshift range $z \approx 0.1 - 1$, require FRB localizations of $\lesssim 20''$. In the absence of a robust association, constraints can be placed on the luminosity of an associated radio source as a function of localization and DM. For DM $\approx 1000 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, an upper limit comparable to the luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source can be placed if the localization is $\lesssim 10''$. We apply our analysis to the case of the ASKAP FRB 170107, using optical and radio observations of the localization region. We identify two candidate hosts based on a ratio of radio-to-optical brightness of $\gtrsim 100$. We find that if one of these is associated with FRB 170107, the resulting radio luminosity ($1 \times 10^{29} - 4 \times 10^{30} \ \rm erg \ s^{-1} \ Hz^{-1}$) is comparable to the luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1802.04690,Kaustubh Rajwade et al.,The Galactic halo pulsar population,"Most population studies of pulsars have hitherto focused on the disc of the Galaxy, the Galactic centre, globular clusters, and nearby galaxies. It is expected that pulsars, by virtue of their natal kicks, are also to be found in the Galactic halo. We investigate the possible population of canonical (i.e. non-recycled) radio pulsars in the halo, estimating the number of such pulsars, and the fraction that is detectable via single pulse and periodicity searches. Additionally, we explore the distributions of flux densities and dispersion measures of this population. We also consider the effects of different velocity models and the evolution of inclination angle and magnetic field on our results. We show that $\sim$33 % of all pulsars beaming towards the Earth are in the halo but the fraction reduces to $\sim$1.5 % if we let the inclination angle and the magnetic field evolve as a falling exponential. Moreover, the fraction that is detectable is significantly limited by the sensitivity of surveys. This population would be most effectively probed by surveys using time-domain periodicity search algorithms. The current non-detections of pulsars in the halo can be explained if we assume that the inclination angle and magnetic field of pulsars evolve with time. We also highlight a possible confusion between bright pulses from halo pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts with low dispersion measures where further follow-up is warranted.",astro-ph.HE

The cross spectrum method is first proposed in Liu et al. (2018), which maximizes the signal power by fully utilizing the fringe phase information of the baseline cross spectrum. The auto spectrum search method is based on the popular pulsar software package PRESTO, which extracts single pulses from the auto spectrum of each station.

Law et al.,"Realfast: Real-Time, Commensal Fast Transient Surveys with the Very Large Array","Radio interferometers have the ability to precisely localize and better characterize the properties of sources. This ability is having a powerful impact on the study of fast radio transients, where a few milliseconds of data is enough to pinpoint a source at cosmological distances. However, recording interferometric data at millisecond cadence produces a terabyte-per-hour data stream that strains networks, computing systems, and archives. This challenge mirrors that of other domains of science, where the science scope is limited by the computational architecture as much as the physical processes at play. Here, we present a solution to this problem in the context of radio transients: realfast, a commensal, fast transient search system at the Jansky Very Large Array. Realfast uses a novel architecture to distribute fast-sampled interferometric data to a 32-node, 64-GPU cluster for real-time imaging and transient detection. By detecting transients in situ, we can trigger the recording of data for those rare, brief instants when the event occurs and reduce the recorded data volume by a factor of 1000. This makes it possible to commensally search a data stream that would otherwise be impossible to record. This system will search for millisecond transients in more than 1000 hours of data per year, potentially localizing several Fast Radio Bursts, pulsars, and other sources of impulsive radio emission. We describe the science scope for realfast, the system design, expected outcomes, and ways real-time analysis can help in other fields of astrophysics.",astro-ph.IM

We investigate the possibility of detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) gravitational lensed by MACHO binaries to constrain their properties. Since lensing events could generate more than one images, lensing by binaries could cause multiple-peak FRBs. The angular separation between these images is roughly $10^{-3}$ mas, which is too small to be resolved. The typical time interval between different images is roughly 1 millisecond (ms). The flux ratio between different images is roughly from 10 to $10^3$. With the expected detection rate of $10^4$ FRBs per year by the upcoming experiments, we could expect five multi-peak FRBs observed per year with time interval larger than 1 ms and flux ratio less than $10^3$ if the fraction of dark matter in MACHOs is $f\sim0.01$.

We predict the distributions of DMs, flux densities, and fluences of FRBs taking account of the variation of the receiver efficiency within its beam, using analytical models of $\rhoFRB (z)$ and LF. Comparing the predictions with the observations, we show that the cumulative distribution of apparent fluences suggests that FRBs originate at cosmological distances and $\rhoFRB$ increases with redshift resembling cosmic star formation history (CSFH). We also show that a LF model with a bright-end cutoff at log$_{10}L_\nu$ [erg s$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$] $\sim$ 34 are favored to reproduce the observed DM distribution if $\rhoFRB (z)\propto$ CSFH, although the statistical significance of the constraints obtained with the current size of the observed sample is not high.

In this model, a supramassive neutron star supported by rapid rotation, will collapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth as a result of spin down. The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines anchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that will propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio burst, i.e. a ""blitzar"". We present a systematic study of the gravitational collapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to far-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series of neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and different magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very robust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying exponentially in amplitude. The luminosity and energy released when the magnetosphere is destroyed are well reproduced by a simple expression in terms of the stellar magnetic field and radius. Finally, we assess the occurrence of pair production during a blitzar scenario, concluding that for typical magnetic-field strengths of $10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin frequencies of a few Hz, pair production is suppressed. Overall, the very good match between the results of the simulations and the luminosities normally observed for FRBs lends credibility to the blitzar model as a simple and yet plausible explanation for the phenomenology of non-repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

The inferred magnetic field strength in the burst environment is comparable to that in the vicinity of the super-massive black hole Sagittarius A* of our Galaxy. Here we show that all the observational properties of FRB 121102 (including the high RM and its evolution, the high linear polarization degree, an invariant polarization angle across each burst and other properties previously known) can be interpreted within the cosmic comb model invoking a regular neutron star whose magnetosphere is sporadically and marginally combed by a variable outflow from a nearby low-luminosity accreting super-massive black hole in the host galaxy.

Michilli et al.,An extreme magneto-ionic environment associated with the fast radio burst source FRB 121102,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, extragalactic radio flashes of unknown physical origin. FRB 121102, the only known repeating FRB source, has been localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy at redshift z = 0.193, and is spatially coincident with a compact, persistent radio source. The origin of the bursts, the nature of the persistent source, and the properties of the local environment are still debated. Here we present bursts that show ~100% linearly polarized emission at a very high and variable Faraday rotation measure in the source frame: RM_src = +1.46 x 10^5 rad m^-2 and +1.33 x 10^5 rad m^-2 at epochs separated by 7 months, in addition to narrow (< 30 mus) temporal structure. The large and variable rotation measure demonstrates that FRB 121102 is in an extreme and dynamic magneto-ionic environment, while the short burst durations argue for a neutron star origin. Such large rotation measures have, until now, only been observed in the vicinities of massive black holes (M_BH > 10^4 MSun). Indeed, the properties of the persistent radio source are compatible with those of a low-luminosity, accreting massive black hole. The bursts may thus come from a neutron star in such an environment.

Working with cross spectrum greatly reduces the effect of radio frequency interference (RFI) compared with using auto spectrum. Single pulse detection confidence increases by cross identifying detections from multiple baselines. By combining the power of multiple baselines, we may improve the detection sensitivity. Our method is similar to that of coherent beam forming, but without the computational expense to form a great number of beams to cover the whole field of view of our telescopes. The data processing pipeline designed for this method is easy to implement and parallelize, which can be deployed in various kinds of VLBI observations.

Here we propose a robust method to test WEP for relativistic messengers using strongly lensed cosmic transients, which can naturally overcome the intrinsic time delay problem. This can be achieved in two ways: by comparing the time delays between lensed images seen in different energy bands or in gravitational waves (GWs) and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The power of our method mainly depends on the timing accuracy of cosmic transient and the strong lensing time delay. If the time delay of cosmic transient can be measured with accuracy about 0.1 s (e.g. gamma-ray bursts), we show that the upper limit on the differences of the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ value is $\Delta \gamma<10^{-7}$ with a one-month strong lensing time delay event.

We review how the physical and cosmological properties of the macroscopic string loops influence experimental searches for these relics from the epoch of inflation. The universe's average density of cosmic superstrings can easily exceed that of conventional cosmic strings having the same tension by two or more orders of magnitude. The cosmological behavior of the remnant superstring loops is qualitatively distinct because the string tension is exponentially smaller than the string scale in flux compactifications in string theory. Low tension superstring loops live longer, experience less recoil (rocket effect from the emission of gravitational radiation) and tend to cluster like dark matter in galaxies. Clustering enhances the string loop density with respect to the cosmological average in collapsed structures in the universe. The enhancement at the Sun's position is $\sim 10^5$. We develop a model encapsulating the leading order string theory effects, the current understanding of the string network loop production and the influence of cosmological structure formation suitable for forecasting the detection of superstring loops via optical microlensing, gravitational wave bursts and fast radio bursts.

arXiv:1712.04806,"Istomin Ya. N, ",On the nature of fast radio bursts,"Scenario of formation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is proposed. Just like radio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of strong electric field in a magnetosphere of a neutron star is associated with close passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source FRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of orbiting of the body is about 200 days. Thermal radiation from the surface of the star (temperature is of the order of $ 10^8 \, K $) causes evaporation and ionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around the magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity $ u \simeq 10^7 \, cm / s $, and creates electric potential $ \psi_0 \simeq 10^{11} \, V $ in the polar region of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated toward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of $ \simeq 10 ^ 5 $. Thermal photons moving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma photons with energies of $ \simeq 10^5 \, m_e c^2 $. These gamma quanta produce electron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity, the number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about $ 10^5 $. The electron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere, accumulates in a narrow layer at a bottom of a potential well formed on one side by a blocking potential $ \psi_0 $, and on the other side by pressure of thermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer increases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for thermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under the layer is accumulated during time $ \simeq 500 \, s $, then the plasma layer is ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed by the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma.",astro-ph.HE

We propose herein a scenario for a collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) as the progenitor of the FRBs by considering the burst duration scaling to the collision time and the radio luminosity proportional to the kinetic energy of the collision. The relations among the observed flux density, pulse width, and the DM are derived from the model and compared with the statistical results from the observed FRBs. Although the sample is quite small, we tentatively report a nearly inverse-square correlation between the observed peak flux density and the DM excess, which is an consequence of the assumption that the DM excess (i.e. that not due to our Galaxy) is dominated by the intergalactic medium. We also tentatively note a correlation among the duration of the FRB and the DM excess (possibly interpreted as due to the broadening of the signal in the intergalactic medium) and a correlation among the duration of the FRB and the flux density (shorter burst should be brighter), both roughly in agreement with the proposed model.",astro-ph.HE

Coherent curvature radiation by bunches has been long discussed as the mechanism for radio pulsars and recently for FRBs. Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar magnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under a three-dimensional magnetic field geometry. Different from previous works assuming parallel trajectories and a mono-energetic energy distribution of electrons, we consider a bunch characterized by its length, curvature radius of the trajectory family, bunch opening angle, and electron energy distribution. We find that the curvature radiation spectra of the bunches are characterized by a multi-segment broken power law, with the break frequencies depending on bunch properties and trajectory configuration. We also emphasize that in a pulsar magnetosphere only the fluctuation of net charges with respect to the background (Goldreich-Julian) outflow can make a contribution to coherent radiation. We apply this model to constrain the observed spectra of pulsars and FRBs. For a typical pulsar ($B_p=10^{12}~{\rm G}$, $P=0.1~{\rm s}$), a small fluctuation of the net charge $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim 0.1 n_{\rm GJ}$ can provide the observable flux. For FRBs, the fluctuating net charge may be larger due to its abrupt nature. For $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim n_{\rm GJ}$, a neutron star with a strong magnetic field and fast rotation is required to power an FRB in the spindown-powered model. The requirement is less stringent in the cosmic comb model thanks to the larger cross section and compressed charge density of the bunch made by the external astrophysical stream that combs the magnetosphere.",astro-ph.HE

Individual galaxies typically produce DM $\sim 25-60$ cm$^{-3}$ pc from ionized gas in their disk, disk-halo interface, and circumgalactic medium. Toward an FRB source at redshift $z$, a homogeneous IGM containing a fraction $f_{\rm IGM}$ of cosmological baryons will produce DM $= (935~{\rm cm}^{-3}~{\rm pc}) f_{\rm IGM} \, h_{70}^{-1} I(z)$, where $I(z) = (2/3 \Omega_m)[ \{ \Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda} \}^{1/2} - 1 ]$. A structured IGM of photoionized Ly-alpha absorbers in the cosmic web produces similar dispersion, modeled from the observed distribution, $f_b(N,z)$, of H I (Lya-forest) absorbers in column density and redshift with ionization corrections and scaling relations from cosmological simulations. An analytic formula for DM($z$) applied to observed FRB dispersions suggests that $z_{\rm FRB} \approx 0.2-1.5$ for an IGM containing a significant baryon fraction, $f_{\rm IGM} = 0.6\pm0.1$. Future surveys of the statistical distribution, DM($z)$, of FRBs identified with specific galaxies and redshifts, can be used to calibrate the IGM baryon fraction and distribution of Ly-alpha absorbers.

Kerr et al.,Extreme Scattering Events Towards Two Young Pulsars,"We have measured the scintillation properties of 151 young, energetic pulsars with the Parkes radio telescope and have identified two extreme scattering events (ESEs). Towards PSR J1057-5226 we discovered a three-year span of strengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density and the scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the scattering region is ~23 au, and strong flux density enhancement before and after the ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest scattering by a screen 100-200 pc from the earth, perhaps ionized filamentary structure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s).   Towards PSR J1740-3015 we observed a ""double dip"" in the measured flux density similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources. The observed shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale diverging plasma lens with electron density ~500cm$^{-3}$ . The continuing ESE is at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to date.   These detections, with materially different observational signatures, indicate that well-calibrated pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE detection and ISM diagnostics. They illustrate the strong r\^ole au-scale non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such events and are key to understanding both their intrinsic physics and their impact on other phenomena, particularly fast radio bursts.",astro-ph.HE

We construct mock catalogues of FRB dispersion measure (DM) data and employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, with which we forecast and compare with existing constraints in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as some popular extensions that include dark energy equation of state and curvature parameters. We find that the scatter in DM observations caused by inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) poses a big challenge to the utility of FRBs as a cosmic probe. Only in the most optimistic case, with a high number of events and low IGM variance, do FRBs aid in improving current constraints. In particular, when FRBs are combined with CMB+BAO+SNe+$H_0$ data, we find the biggest improvement comes in the $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$ constraint. Also, we find that the dark energy equation of state is poorly constrained, while the constraint on the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, shows some improvement when combined with current constraints. When FRBs are combined with future BAO data from 21cm Intensity Mapping (IM), we find little improvement over the constraints from BAOs alone. However, the inclusion of FRBs introduces an additional parameter constraint, $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$, which turns out to be comparable to existing constraints. This suggest that FRBs provide valuable information about the cosmological baryon density in the intermediate redshift Universe, independent of high redshift CMB data.",astro-ph.CO

Here we show that a novel way involving enhanced giant radio pulses from a rapidly spun-up neutron star near a spinning black hole can explain the main properties of non-repeating FRBs. Independent observations of such pulses, which are not enhanced, from some Galactic pulsars make our model reliable. If correct, our model would imply the existence of event horizons, the Lense-Thirring effect, and a significant spin energy extraction from a black hole. Moreover, an FRB would then probe the pulsar magnetosphere and its emission, and map the strong gravity region near a black hole. Besides, our model predicts simultaneous detections of FRBs and gravitational waves from black hole -- neutron star mergers for fortuitously nearby FRB events.",astro-ph.HE

Our real-time discoveries have enabled us to conduct extensive, rapid multi-messenger follow-up at 12 major facilities sensitive to radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray photons and neutrinos on time scales ranging from an hour to a few months post-burst. No counterparts to the FRBs were found and we provide upper limits on afterglow luminosities. None of the FRBs were seen to repeat. Formal fits to all FRBs show hints of scattering while their intrinsic widths are unresolved in time. FRB 151206 is at low Galactic latitude, FRB 151230 shows a sharp spectral cutoff, and FRB 160102 has the highest dispersion measure (DM = $2596.1\pm0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$) detected to date. Three of the FRBs have high dispersion measures (DM >$1500$ pc cm$^{-3}$), favouring a scenario where the DM is dominated by contributions from the Intergalactic Medium. The slope of the Parkes FRB source counts distribution with fluences $>2$ Jyms is $\alpha=-2.2^{+0.6}_{-1.2}$ and still consistent with a Euclidean distribution ($\alpha=-3/2$). We also find that the all-sky rate is $1.7^{+1.5}_{-0.9}\times10^3$FRBs/($4\pi$ sr)/day above $\sim2$ Jyms and there is currently no strong evidence for a latitude-dependent FRB sky-rate.",astro-ph.HE

We speculate on the cause of such enhancements (i.e. propagation or telescope-related) and the ramifications they bring to the single-pulse studies at the very low radio frequencies. Depending on the origin, the phenomenon may also affect the analysis of highly dispersed single pulses at higher radio frequencies, e.g. Fast Radio Bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Based on a dedicated suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the ENZO code we have performed a survey of different models that may have caused present-day magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters. The outcomes of these models differ in cluster outskirts, filaments, sheets and voids and we use these simulations to find observational signatures of magnetogenesis. With these simulations, we predict the signal of extragalactic magnetic fields in radio observations of synchrotron emission from the cosmic web, in Faraday Rotation, in the propagation of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, in the polarized signal from Fast Radio Bursts at cosmological distance and in spectra of distant blazars. In general, primordial scenarios in which present-day magnetic fields originate from the amplification of weak (<nG) uniform seed fields result more homogeneous and relatively easier to observe magnetic fields than than astrophysical scenarios, in which present-day fields are the product of feedback processes triggered by stars and active galaxies. In the near future the best evidence for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields will most likely come from a combination of synchrotron emission and Faraday Rotation observed at the periphery of large-scale structures.",astro-ph.CO

Three DLA measures form the basis of this analysis: (i) the HI column density distribution, parameterized as a double power-law; (ii) the incidence of DLAs with redshift (derived here), $\ell(z)=A+B \arctan(z-C)$ with $A=0.236_{-0.021}^{+0.016}, B=0.168_{-0.017}^{+0.010}, C=2.87_{-0.13}^{+0.17}$ and (iii) the electron density, parameterized as a log-normal deviate with mean $10^{-2.6} cm^{-3}$ and dispersion 0.3dex. Synthesizing these results, we estimate that the average rest-frame dispersion measure from the neutral medium of a single, intersecting galaxy is DM$^{NM}_{DLA}=0.25$ pc/cm^3. Analysis of AlIII and CII* absorption limits the putative warm ionized medium to contribute DM$^{WIM}_{DLA}<20$pc/cm^3. Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a population of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a 99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in external galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the angular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible ($\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\tau \approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing frequency of $\nu=1$GHz. Even with $\nu=600$MHz, the fraction of sightlines broadened beyond 25ms is only approximately 0.1%. We conclude that gas within the ISM of intervening galaxies has a minor effect on the detection of FRBs and their resultant DM distributions.

We demonstrate that the Lorimer burst (FRB 010724) is subject to discovery bias, and should be excluded from all statistical studies of the population. We re-examine the evidence for flat, $\alpha >-1$, source counts estimates based on the ratio of single-beam to multiple-beam detections with the Parkes multi-beam receiver, and show that current data implies only a very weak constraint of $\alpha \lesssim -1.3$. A maximum likelihood analysis applied to the portion of the Parkes FRB population detected above the observational completeness fluence of 2 Jy ms yields $\alpha = -2.6_{-1.3}^{+0.7}$.

arXiv:1710.10270,"Wenbin Lu, Pawan Kumar, ",On the radiation mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts,"Recent observations show that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are energetic but probably non-catastrophic events occurring at cosmological distances. The properties of their progenitors are largely unknown in spite of many attempts to determine them using the event rate, duration and energetics. Understanding the radiation mechanism for FRBs should provide the missing insights regarding their progenitors, which is investigated in this paper. The high brightness temperatures (>10^{35} K) of FRBs mean that the emission process must be coherent. Two general classes of coherent radiation mechanisms are considered --- maser and the antenna mechanism. We use the observed properties of the repeater FRB 121102 to constrain the plasma conditions needed for these two mechanisms. We have looked into a wide variety of maser mechanisms operating in either vacuum or plasma and find that none of them can explain the high luminosity of FRBs without invoking unrealistic or fine-tuned plasma conditions. The most favorable mechanism is antenna curvature emission by coherent charge bunches where the burst is powered by magnetic reconnection near the surface of a magnetar (B > 10^{14} G). We show that the plasma in the twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar may be clumpy due to two-stream instability. When magnetic reconnection occurs, the pre-existing density clumps may provide charge bunches for the antenna mechanism to operate. This model should be applicable to all FRBs that have multiple outbursts like FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1710.10185,"Richard Lieu, ",Large scale density perturbations from a uniform distribution by wave transport,"It has long been known that a uniform distribution of matter cannot produce a Poisson distribution of density fluctuations on very large scales $1/k > ct$ by the motion of discrete particles over timescale $t$. The constraint is part of what is sometimes referred to as the Zel'dovich bound. We investigate in this paper the transport of energy by the propagation of waves emanating {\it incoherently} from a regular and infinite lattice of oscillators, each having the same finite amount of energy reserve initially. The model we employ does not involve the expansion of the Universe -- the scales of interest are all deeply sub-horizon -- but the size of regions over which perturbations are evaluated far exceed $ct$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the start of emission (it is assumed that $t$ greatly exceeds the duration of emission). We find that to lowest order, when only wave fields $\propto 1/r$ are included, there is exact compensation between the energy loss of the oscillators and the energy emitted into space, which means $P(0)=0$ for the power spectrum of density fluctuations on the largest scales. This is consistent with the Zel'dovich bound. To the next order when near fields $\propto r^{-2}$ are included, however, $P(0)$ settles at late times to a positive value that depends only on time, as $t^{-2}$ (the same applies to an energy non-conserving term). Even though this effect looks like superluminal energy transport, there is no violation of causality because the two-point function vanishes completely for $r>t$ if the emission of each oscillator is truncated beyond some duration. The result calls to question any need of enlisting cosmic inflation to seed large scale density perturbations. When applied to fast radio bursts -- uniformly distributed transients (to lowest order) that repeat at other locations -- the result supports Hoyle's hypothesis of constant energy injection.",astro-ph.CO

These include algorithms for forming arbitrarily pointed tied-array beams from the regularly spaced Fourier-transform formed beams, sculpting the beams to suppress sidelobes while only losing percent-level sensitivity, and optimally estimating the position of a detected source from its observed brightness in the set of beams.

In this paper we outline a proposed VOEvent standard for FRBs that includes the essential parameters of the event and where these parameters should be specified within the structure of the event. An additional advantage to the use of VOEvents for FRBs is that the events can automatically be ingested into the FRB Catalogue (FRBCAT) enabling real-time updates for public use.

The spectral profiles, cooling rate, and photometric light curves are consistent with the expected outburst and subsequent processes of a binary neutron star merger. Star formation in the host galaxy probably ceased at least a Gyr ago, although there is evidence for a galaxy merger. Binary pulsars with short (100 Myr) decay times are therefore unlikely progenitors, but pulsars like PSR B1534+12 with its 2.7 Gyr coalescence time could produce such a merger.

However, the merger environment is polluted by dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102. We show that a merger remnant would appear as a repeating FRB in a time scale of about 1-10 yrs, and expected properties are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102. We construct an FRB rate evolution model including these two populations of repeating and non-repeating FRBs from BNS mergers, and show that the detection rate of repeating FRBs relative to non-repeating ones rapidly increases with improving search sensitivity. This may explain that the only repeating FRB 121102 was discovered by the most sensitive FRB search with Arecibo.

Very recently, 15 new bursts were detected by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) during its continous monitoring observations. In this letter, we show that the burst energy distribution has a power law form which is very similar to the Gutenberg-Richter law of earthquakes. In addition, the waiting time of the burst has a Gaussian distribution, which is also a distinctive feature of earthquakes. These findings suggest that the repeating FRB pulses may originate from the starquakes of a pulsar. Noting that the soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) also exhibit such distributions, the FRB could be powered by some mechanism associated with the SGRs, including crustal acitivity of a magnetar, solidification-induced stresss of a young strangeon star, and oscillation-drivern magnetic activities of a slowly rotating pulsar.

In this paper, we demonstrate how Dicke's superradiance, for which evidence has recently been found in the interstellar medium, can account for the characteristics associated to FRBs.

We describe how the deployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) has transformed MOST into a versatile new instrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky on millisecond timescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The filterbanks, servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a hybrid solution to the observatory's signal processing requirements. The emphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware has enabled rapid deployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal processing. The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST and double the sampling of the line feed, which doubles the field of view. The UTMOST can simultaneously excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse pulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams for dispersed single pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar timing and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have been made.

Hassan et al.,MAGIC sensitivity to millisecond-duration optical pulses,"The MAGIC telescopes are a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed to observe very high energy (VHE) gamma rays above ~50 GeV. However, as IACTs are sensitive to Cherenkov light in the UV/blue and use photo-detectors with a time response well below the ms scale, MAGIC is also able to perform simultaneous optical observations. Through an alternative system installed in the central PMT of MAGIC II camera, the so-called central pixel, MAGIC is sensitive to short (1ms - 1s) optical pulses. Periodic signals from the Crab pulsar are regularly monitored. Here we report for the first time the experimental determination of the sensitivity of the central pixel to isolated 1-10 ms long optical pulses.

arXiv:1708.07507,"Gabriele Ghisellini, Nicola Locatelli, ",Coherent curvature radiation and Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts are extragalactic radio transient events lasting a few milliseconds with a ~Jy flux at ~1 GHz. We propose that these properties suggest a neutron star progenitor, and focus on coherent curvature radiation as the radiation mechanism. We study for which sets of parameters the emission can fulfil the observational constraints. Even if the emission is coherent, we find that self-absorption can limit the produced luminosities at low radio frequencies and that an efficient re-acceleration process is needed to balance the dramatic energy losses of the emitting particles. Self-absorption limits the luminosities at low radio frequency, while coherence favours steep optically thin spectra. Furthermore, the magnetic geometry must have a high degree of order to obtain coherent curvature emission. Particles emit photons along their velocity vectors, thereby greatly reducing the inverse Compton mechanism. In this case we predict that fast radio bursts emit most of their luminosities in the radio band and have no strong counterpart in any other frequency bands.",astro-ph.HE

Unlike the luminosity and angular diameter distances, which correspond to the angular size, the proper distance is the length of light path from the source to observer. However, the proper distance has not been measured before. The recent redshift measurement of a repeat fast radio burst (FRB) can shed light on the proper distance. We show that the proper distance-redshift relation can indeed be derived from dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs with measured redshifts. From Monte Carlo simulations, we find that about 500 FRBs with DM and redshift measurements can tightly constrain the proper distance-redshift relation. We also show that the curvature of our Universe can be constrained with a model-independent method using this derived proper distance-redshift relation and the observed angular diameter distances. Owing to the high event rate of FRBs, hundreds of FRBs can be discovered in the future by upcoming instruments. The proper distance will play an important role in investigating the accelerating expansion and the geometry of the Universe.",astro-ph.CO

Since the time delay between images of strongly lensed FRB can be measured to extremely high precision because of the large ratio $\sim10^9$ between the typical galaxy-lensing delay time $\sim\mathcal{O}$(10 days) and the width of bursts $\sim\mathcal{O}$(ms), we propose strongly lensed FRBs as precision probes of the universe. We show that, within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be constrained with a $\sim0.91\%$ uncertainty from 10 such systems probably observed with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) in $<$ 30 years. More importantly, the cosmic curvature can be model-independently constrained to a precision of $\sim0.076$.

arXiv:1708.06352,"Nicola Locatelli, Gabriele Ghisellini, ",Cross section of curvature radiation absorption,"When treating the absorption of light, one focuses on the absorption coefficient, related to the probability of photons to survive while traversing a layer of material. From the point of view of particles doing the absorption, however, the elementary interaction of the particle with the photon is best described by the corresponding cross section. We revisit curvature radiation in order to find the absorption cross section for this process, making use of the Einstein coefficients and their relations with spontaneous and stimulated emission and true absorption. We derive the cross section as a function of the emission angle psi (i.e. the angle between the instantaneous velocity vector and the direction of the photon), and the cross section integrated over angles. Both are positive, contrary to the synchrotron case for which the cross section can be negative for large psi. Therefore, it is impossible to have curvature radiation masers. This has important consequences on sources of very large brightness temperatures that require a coherent emission process, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Although the origin of FRBs remains unknown, most of the existing theoretical models are associated with pulsars, or more specifically, magnetars. In this paper, we explore persistent high-energy emission from a rapidly rotating highly magnetized pulsar associated with FRB 121102 if internal gradual magnetic dissipation occurs in the pulsar wind. We find that the efficiency of converting the spin-down luminosity to the high-energy (e.g., X-ray) luminosity is generally much smaller than unity, even for a millisecond magnetar. This provides an explanation for the non-detection of high-energy counterparts to FRB 121102. We further constrain the spin period and surface magnetic field strength of the pulsar with the current high-energy observations. In addition, we compare our results with the constraints given by the other methods in previous works and would expect to apply our new method to some other open issues in the future.",astro-ph.HE

Wang, ",A New Method to Test the Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle,"The Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP) is one of the foundational assumptions of general relativity and some other gravity theories. In the theory of parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN), the difference between the PPN parameters $\gamma$ of different particles or the same type of particle with different energies, $\Delta \gamma$, represents the violation of WEP. Current constraints on $\Delta \gamma$ are derived from the observed time delay between correlated particles of astronomical sources. However, the observed time delay is contaminated by other effects, such as the time delays due to different particle emission times, the potential Lorentz invariance violation and none-zero photon rest mass. Therefore, current constraints are only upper limits. Here we propose a new method to test WEP based on the fact that the gravitational time delay is direction-dependent while others are not. This is the first method which can naturally correct other time delay effects. Using the time delay measurements of BASTE gamma-ray burst (GRB) sample and the gravitational potential of local super galaxy cluster Laniakea, we find that the constraint on $\Delta \gamma$ of different energy photons can be as low as $10^{-14}$. In the future, if more gravitational wave events and fast radio bursts with much more precise time delay measurements are observed, this method can give a reliable and tight constraint on WEP.",astro-ph.HE

Using the FIRST radio catalog, I present a search for luminous persistent sources in nearby galaxies, with radio luminosities >10% of the FRB 121102 persistent source luminosity. The galaxy sample contains about 30% of the total galaxy g-band luminosity within <108 Mpc, in a footprint of 10,600 deg^2. After rejecting sources likely due to active galactic nuclei activity or background sources, I remain with 11 candidates that are presumably associated with galactic disks or star formation regions. At least some of these candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find 85 sources within 1"" of galactic nuclei. Assuming the radio persistent sources are not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band light, the 11 sources imply a 95% confidence upper limit on the space density of luminous persistent sources of <5x10^-5 Mpc^-3, and that at any given time only a small fraction of galaxies host a radio luminous persistent source (<10^-3 L_*^-1). Assuming persistent sources life time of 100 yr, this implies a birth rate of <5x10^-7 yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and assuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources, this sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of >0.8 yr^-1.

arXiv:1707.08979,Qiwu Song et al.,The radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts are radio transients observed mainly around 1.5 GHz. Their peak frequency decreases at a rate of 100 ~ 500 MHz/s and some of them have a broader pulse with an exponentially decaying tail. Common assumptions for fast radio bursts include a dispersion effect resulting in the peak frequency drifting and a scattering effect resulting in pulse broadening. These assumptions attribute the abnormally large dispersion measure and scattering measure to the environmental medium of the host galaxy. Here we show that the radiation of fast radio bursts can be explained as an undulator radiation and the large dispersion measure can be due to a motion effect mainly from the rotation of the source which is probably variable stars. In our scenario, the pulse broadening is near-field effects and the pulse itself represents a Fresnel diffraction pattern sweeping the observer. Our work is the first analysis of properties of fast radio bursts in the context of a special mechanism of the radiation instead of a special propagation environment of the radiation.",astro-ph.HE

Young neutron stars are involved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has been suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be produced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using VLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact component not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the first time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr old) supernova. We show that at age 30 yr, any FRB signal at ~1 GHz would still be largely absorbed by the ejecta. By the time the ejecta have expanded so that a 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN ejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion measures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to propagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at distances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc. We conclude that if FRBs originate in Type II SNe/SNRs, they would likely not become visible till 60 ~ 200 yr after the SN explosion.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1707.04827,"Aiichi Iwazaki, ",Axion Stars and Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Finite Bandwidths,"We have proposed a model of non repeating fast radio bursts ( FRBs ); the collisions between axion stars and neutron stars generate the bursts. In this paper, we propose a model of repeating FRBs which shows that they arise from the several collisions between magnetized accretion disk of a black hole and an axion star orbiting the black hole. There would be many axions stars condensing as dark matter in an early stage galaxy so that such collisions arises repeatedly. The radiations are emitted by coherent oscillations of electrons in the accretion disk. The oscillations are caused by oscillating electric fields, which are induced by axion stars under strong magnetic field $\sim O(10^{11})$G. The emissions are terminated by the thermal fluctuations of the electrons which result from the thermalization of the oscillation energies. Although the radiations are monochromatic, the thermal Doppler effects broaden the spectral lines; their spectra $S(\nu)$ are given by $S(\nu) \propto \exp(-(\nu-\nu_c)^2/2(\delta\nu)^2)$ with the center frequency $\nu_c$. The bandwidth $\delta\nu=\nu_c\sqrt{T_c/m_e}$ with electron mass $m_e$ is determined by the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the thermal fluctuations terminate the coherent emissions. The observed bandwidths $(3\sim5)\times10^2$MHz are originated from the strong magnetic fields $\sim O(10^{11})$G. With such strong magnetic fields, large amount of the burst energies are produced. Various center frequencies $\nu_c$ of the bursts in the repeating FRB 121102 come from the various rotation speeds in the disk which make an intrinsic frequency of the bursts being Doppler shifted. The recent observation showing an extreme magneto-ionic environment around the source of FRB 121102 supports our model.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1707.02923,"Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, ",Dispersion Measure Variation of Repeating Fast Radio Burst Sources,"The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 was recently localized in a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological distance. The dispersion measure (DM) derived for each burst from FRB 121102 so far has not shown significant evolution, even though an apparent increase was recently seen with newly detected VLA bursts. It is expected that more repeating FRB sources may be detected in the future. In this work, we investigate a list of possible astrophysical processes that might cause DM variation of a particular FRB source. The processes include (1) the cosmological scale effects such as Hubble expansion and large-scale structure fluctuations; (2) the FRB local effects such as gas density fluctuation, expansion of a supernova remnant, a pulsar wind nebula, and an HII region; and (3) the propagation effect due to plasma lensing. We find that the DM variations contributed by the large-scale structure are extremely small, and any observable DM variation is likely caused by the plasma local to the FRB source. Besides mechanisms that produce decreasing DM with time, we suggest that an FRB source in an expanding supernova remnant around a nearly neutral ambient medium during the deceleration (Sedov-Taylor and snowplow) phases or in a growing HII region can introduce DM increasing. Some effects (e.g. an FRB source moving in an HII region or plasma lensing) can give either positive or negative DM variations.

We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved with VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could reveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot. This can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments, constraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if FRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions for which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing precision possible for FRBs ($\sim {\rm ms}$) compared to the typical time delays between images in galaxy lensing ($\gtrsim 10\, {\rm days}$) enables the measurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays ($\sim 10^{-9}$), and hence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions between the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic peculiar velocities only cause the delay time to drift linearly, and that the effect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus enabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of $\sim 1\,$ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) $\sim 0.05$ per day of a single FRB source, non-uniform displacement $\gtrsim 0.1 - 1\,$AU of the emission spot perpendicular to the line of sight is detectable if repetitions are seen over a period of hundreds of days.",astro-ph.HE

We detected a compact H$\alpha$-emitting (i.e., star-forming) region in the galaxy, which has a much smaller angular size [$< 0"".57$ (1.9 kpc) at full width at half maximum (FWHM)] than the extended stellar continuum emission region determined by the Gemini/GMOS z'-band image [$\simeq 1"".4$ (4.6 kpc) at FWHM with ellipticity b/a=0.45]. The spatial offset between the centroid of the H$\alpha$ emission region and the position of the radio bursts is $0"".08 \pm 0"".02$ ($0.26 \pm 0.07$ kpc), indicating that FRB 121102 is located within the star-forming region. This close spatial association of FRB 121102 with the star-forming region is consistent with expectations from young pulsar/magnetar models for FRB 121102, and it also suggests that the observed H$\alpha$ emission region can make a major dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the host galaxy DM component of FRB 121102. Nevertheless, the largest possible value of the DM contribution from the H$\alpha$ emission region inferred from our observations still requires a significant amount of ionized baryons in intergalactic medium (the so-called `missing' baryons) as the DM source of FRB 121102, and we obtain a 90\% confidence level lower limit on the cosmic baryon density in the intergalactic medium in the low-redshift universe as $\Omega_{IGM} > 0.012$.",astro-ph.GA

One possibility is that the repeating FRBs are produced by a new-born magnetar, which also powers the radio nebula. If so, the magnetar may produce $\gamma$-ray emission due to magnetic dipolar spin-down. The luminosity depends on the magnetar spin parameters and age. We process the eight-year Fermi LAT data at the position of FRB 121102 and place an energy flux upper limit of $\sim 10^{-11} \ {\rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ in time bins with six-month intervals, and an accumulated energy flux upper limit of $\sim 4\times 10^{-12} \ {\rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ over the eight year span. The corresponding $\gamma$-ray luminosity upper limits are $\sim 10^{45} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ and $\sim 4\times 10^{44} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ for the time-resolved and time-integrated analyses, respectively.

Motivated by this, we here search for GeV counterparts to all non-repeating FRBs with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), including FRB 131104 that is claimed to be possibly associated with a gamma-ray transient candidate detected by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). FRB 131104 enters the field of view (FoV) of LAT ~5000s after the burst time, so we are only able to search for the GeV afterglow emission during this period, but no significant GeV emission is detected. We also perform a search for GeV emissions from other FRBs, but no significant GeV emissions are detected either. Upper limit fluences in the range of (4.7-29.2)x10^(-7) erg/cm2 are obtained, and then the upper limits of the isotropic blast wave kinetic energy of about (1-200)x10^(53) erg are inferred under certain assumptions.

Berger, ",Associating Fast Radio Bursts with Their Host Galaxies,"The first precise localization of a fast radio burst (FRB), leading to an association with a low metallicity dwarf galaxy at $z=0.193$, has began to shed light on the nature of these mysterious bursts and the physical mechanisms that power them. Increasing the sample of FRBs with robust host galaxy associations is the key impetus behind on-going and upcoming searches and facilities. Here, we quantify the robustness of FRB-host galaxy associations as a function of localization area and galaxy apparent magnitude. We also explore the use of FRB dispersion measures to constrain the source redshift, thereby reducing the number of candidate hosts. We further use these results to demonstrate that even in the absence of a robust unique association, a constraint can be placed on the maximum luminosity of a host galaxy as a function of localization area and DM. We examine these results in the context of existing and future FRB facilities. We find that localizations of $\lesssim 0.5''$ are required for a chance coincidence probability of $\lesssim 1\%$ for dwarf galaxies at $z\gtrsim 0.1$; if some hosts have luminosities of $\sim L^*$, then localizations of up to $\approx 3''$ may suffice at $z\sim 0.1$ (but $\lesssim 1''$ at $z\approx 1$). Constraints on the redshift from the DM only marginally improve the association probability, unless the DM is low, $\lesssim 400$ pc cm$^{-3}$ ($z\lesssim 0.5$). This approach also relies on the determination of galaxy redshifts, which is challenging at $z\gtrsim 0.5$ if the hosts are generally dwarf galaxies. Finally, interesting limits on the maximum host luminosity (for example, sufficient to demonstrate that the hosts are generally dwarf galaxies) require localizations of $\lesssim 5''$ at $z\gtrsim 0.1$. Even a few such localizations will shed light on the nature of FRB progenitors, their possible diversity, and their use as cosmological tools.",astro-ph.HE

Petroff et al.,A polarized fast radio burst at low Galactic latitude,"We report on the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB 150215, with the Parkes radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time with a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6$\pm$0.8 pc cm^{-3}, a pulse duration of 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5} ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming the burst was at beam center of 0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic longitude and latitude of 24.66^{\circ}, 5.28^{\circ}, 25 degrees away from the Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43$\pm$5% linearly polarized with a rotation measure (RM) in the range -9 < RM < 12 rad m^{-2} (95% confidence level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed-up with 11 telescopes to search for radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino emission. Neither transient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and no repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 hours of observing. The sightline to the burst is close to the Galactic plane and the observed physical properties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence of sight lines of anomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic RM foreground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the line of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or some combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might explain why this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude have had lower detection rates than those out of the plane.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1705.01278,"Lijing Shao, Bing Zhang, ",A Bayesian Framework to Constrain the Photon Mass with a Catalog of Fast Radio Bursts,"A hypothetical photon mass, $m_\gamma$, gives an energy-dependent light speed in a Lorentz-invariant theory. Such a modification causes an additional time delay between photons of different energies when they travel through a fixed distance. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their short time duration and cosmological propagation distance, are excellent astrophysical objects to constrain $m_\gamma$. Here for the first time we develop a Bayesian framework to study this problem with a catalog of FRBs. Those FRBs with and without redshift measurement are both useful in this framework, and can be combined in a Bayesian way. A catalog of 21 FRBs (including 20 FRBs without redshift measurement, and one, FRB 121102, with a measured redshift $z=0.19273 \pm 0.00008$) give a combined limit $m_\gamma \leq 8.7 \times 10^{-51}\, {\rm kg}$, or equivalently $m_\gamma \leq 4.9 \times 10^{-15}\, {\rm eV}/c^2$ ($m_\gamma \leq 1.5\times10^{-50} \, {\rm kg}$, or equivalently $m_\gamma \leq 8.4 \times 10^{-15} \,{\rm eV}/c^2$) at 68% (95%) confidence level, which represents the best limit that comes purely from kinematics.

Narrowly collimated radiation is emitted along the wandering instantaneous angular momentum axis of accreted matter. We observe this emission as a fast radio burst when it sweeps across the direction to the observer. This model constrains the mass of the black hole to values below those of galactic nuclei. It predicts, in contrast to neutron star (pulsar or SGR) models, that repeating FRB will not be periodic and will be co-located with persistent but variable radio sources resulting from the off-axis emission. The model is analogous, on smaller spatial, lower mass and accretion rate and shorter temporal scales, to AGN making double radio sources, with FRB corresponding to blazars in which the jets point toward us.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1704.08097,Florencia L. Vieyro et al.,A model for the repeating FRB 121102 in the AGN scenario,"Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are transient sources of unknown origin. Recent radio and optical observations have provided strong evidence for an extragalactic origin of the phenomenon and the precise localization of the repeating FRB 121102. Observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) have revealed the existence of a continuum non-thermal radio source consistent with the location of the bursts in a dwarf galaxy. All these new data rule out several models that were previously proposed, and impose stringent constraints to new models. We aim to model FRB 121102 in light of the new observational results in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) scenario. We propose a model for repeating FRBs in which a non-steady relativistic $e^\pm$-beam, accelerated by an impulsive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-driven mechanism, interacts with a cloud at the centre of a star-forming dwarf galaxy. The interaction generates regions of high electrostatic field called cavitons in the plasma cloud. Turbulence is also produced in the beam. These processes, plus particle isotropization, the interaction scale, and light retardation effects, provide the necessary ingredients for short-lived, bright coherent radiation bursts. The mechanism studied in this work explains the general properties of FRB 121102, and may also be applied to other repetitive FRBs. Coherent emission from electrons and positrons accelerated in cavitons provides a plausible explanation of FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

This system is believed to eject a small amount of mass of $\mathcal{O}(0.1M_{\odot})$ at the second core-collapse supernova. We argue that the initial spin of the new-born pulsar can be determined by the orbital period at the time when the second supernova occurs. The spin angular momentum of the progenitor is expected to be similar to that of the He-burning core, which is tidally synchronized with the orbital motion, and then the second remnant may be born as a millisecond pulsar. If the dipole magnetic field strength of the nascent pulsar is comparable to that inferred from the current spin-down rate of PSR J0737-3039B, the initial spin-down luminosity is comparable to the luminosity of super-luminous supernovae. We consider thermal emission arising from the supernova ejecta driven by the relativistic wind from such a new-born pulsar. The resulting optical light curves have a rising time $\sim 10$ days and peak luminosity $\sim 10^{44}$ erg/s. The optical emission may last for a month to several months, due to the reprocessing of X-rays and UV photons via photoelectric absorption. These features are broadly consistent with those of the rapidly-rising optical transients. The high spin-down luminosity and small ejecta mass are favorable for the progenitor of the repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102.

Such processes may explain the fast radio bursts phenomenology, in particular their millisecond durations, large luminosities ${\sim}10^{43}$ erg/s, high rate of occurrence $\gtrsim 1000/\mbox{day}$, as well as high brightness temperatures, polarized emission and Faraday rotation. Longer than the dynamical timescale of the Bondi-like accretion for light primordial black holes allows for the repeating fast radio bursts. This explanation follows naturally from (assumed) existence of the dark matter primordial black holes and requires no additional unusual phenomena, in particular no unacceptably large magnetic fields of neutron stars.

A PBH captured by a neutron star (NS) sinks to the center of the NS and consumes it from the inside. When this occurs in a rotating millisecond-period NS, the resulting spin-up ejects $\sim 0.1-0.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ of relatively cold neutron-rich material. This ejection process and the accompanying decompression and decay of nuclear matter can produce electromagnetic transients, such as a kilonova-type afterglow and fast radio bursts. These transients are not accompanied by significant gravitational radiation or neutrinos, allowing such events to be differentiated from compact object mergers occurring within the distance sensitivity limits of gravitational wave observatories. The PBH-NS destruction scenario is consistent with pulsar and NS statistics, the dark matter content and spatial distributions in the Galaxy and Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFD), as well as with the $r$-process content and evolution histories in these sites. Ejected matter is heated by beta decay, which leads to emission of positrons in an amount consistent with the observed 511-keV line from the Galactic Center.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1704.00022,M. Nicholl et al.,Empirical constraints on the origin of fast radio bursts: volumetric rates and host galaxy demographics as a test of millisecond magnetar connection,"The localization of the repeating FRB 121102 to a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy at $z=0.193$, and its association with a quiescent radio source, suggests the possibility that FRBs originate from magnetars, formed by the unusual supernovae in such galaxies. We investigate this via a comparison of magnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We calculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production channels such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae. For each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using their known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of FRB emitters (the product of their volumetric birthrate and lifetime), $R_{\rm FRB}\tau\approx 10^4$Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted from repetitive sources similar to FRB 121102 and adopting a beaming factor of 0.1. By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs) implies a typical FRB lifetime of $\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with other lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent with the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any relation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse supernovae leads to a very short lifetime of $\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and observation. We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions of the different progenitor channels, many possible sources of FRB birth can be ruled out with $\lesssim 10$ host galaxy identifications. Conversely, targeted searches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs may be a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio sources, and determining the nature of their progenitors.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1703.10173,M. Caleb et al.,The first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts,"We present the first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), an enigmatic new class of astrophysical transient. In a 180-day survey of the Southern sky we discovered 3 FRBs at 843 MHz with the UTMOST array, as part of commissioning science during a major ongoing upgrade. The wide field of view of UTMOST ($\approx 9$ deg$^{2}$) is well suited to FRB searches. The primary beam is covered by 352 partially overlapping fan-beams, each of which is searched for FRBs in real time with pulse widths in the range 0.655 to 42 ms, and dispersion measures $\leq$2000 pc cm$^{-3}$. Detections of FRBs with the UTMOST array places a lower limit on their distances of $\approx 10^4$ km (limit of the telescope near-field) supporting the case for an astronomical origin. Repeating FRBs at UTMOST or an FRB detected simultaneously with the Parkes radio telescope and UTMOST, would allow a few arcsec localisation, thereby providing an excellent means of identifying FRB host galaxies, if present. Up to 100 hours of follow-up for each FRB has been carried out with the UTMOST, with no repeating bursts seen. From the detected position, we present 3$\sigma$ error ellipses of 15 arcsec x 8.4 deg on the sky for the point of origin for the FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a fluence $\cal F_\mathrm{lim}$ of 11 Jy ms of $\sim 78$ events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95 percent confidence level. The measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is of order two times higher than we had expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes radio telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a uniform distribution in Euclidean space. We examine how this can be explained by FRBs having a steeper spectral index and/or a flatter log$N$-log$\mathcal{F}$ distribution than expected for a Euclidean Universe.",astro-ph.HE

Since the polarization of a photon is considered to be part of its internal structure, we propose that polarized photons from astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and fast radio bursts (FRBs), can be used to constrain the accuracy of the WEP through the Shapiro time delay effect. Assuming that the arrival time delays of photons with different polarizations are mainly attributed to the gravitational potential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, we show that a strict upper limit on the differences of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ value for the polarized optical emission of GRB 120308A is $\Delta\gamma<1.2\times10^{-10}$, for the polarized gamma-ray emission of GRB 100826A is $\Delta\gamma<1.2\times10^{-10}$, and for the polarized radio emission of FRB 150807 is $\Delta\gamma<2.2\times10^{-16}$. These are the first direct verifications of the WEP for multiband photons with different polarizations. In particular, the result from FRB 150807 provides the most stringent limit to date on a deviation from the WEP, improving by one order of magnitude the previous best result based on Crab pulsar photons with different energies.",astro-ph.HE

We find that whereas other FRBs occupy the upper (large $S_i / S_{i+1}$) and right (large $\Delta t$) regions of the plane due to the non-detections of other bursts, some of the repeater bursts fall into the lower-left region of the plot (short interval and small flux ratio) excluded by the non-detection data of other FRBs. The trend also exists even if one only selects those bursts detectable by the Parkes radio telescope. If other FRBs were similar to the repeater, our simulations suggest that the probability that none of them have been detected to repeat with the current searches would be $\sim (10^{-4}-10^{-3})$.

arXiv:1703.06723,"Eli Waxman, ",On the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs),"We derive stringent constraints on the persistent source associated with FRB 121102: Size $10^{17}$ cm $<R<10^{18}$ cm, age $<300$ yr, characteristic electron energy $\varepsilon_e\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\sim10^{49}$ erg. The hot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03 (R/10^{17.5}{\rm cm})^4 M_\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be resolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\varepsilon_e\sim m_p c^2$ suggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly relativistic, $M\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended ambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred plasma properties are inconsistent with typical ""magnetar wind nebulae"" model predictions.   We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of the persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object, $R_s\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$ erg and Lorentz factor $\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with density $n\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing the persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with energy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong synchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\nu_{ coh.}\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of the deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied by ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB.   The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to those of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a ""weak stellar explosion"", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and energy ejection.

To produce caustics, the lens' dispersion-measure depth (${\rm DM}_{\ell}$), scale size ($a$), and distance from the source ($d_{\rm sl}$) must satisfy ${\rm DM}_{\ell} d_{\rm sl} / a^2 \gtrsim 0.65~ {\rm pc^2 \ AU^{-2} \ cm^{-3}}$. Caustics produce strong magnifications ($\lesssim 10^2$) on short time scales ($\sim$ hours to days and perhaps shorter) along with narrow, epoch dependent spectral peaks (0.1 to 1~GHz). However, strong suppression also occurs in long-duration ($\sim$ months) troughs. For geometries that produce multiple images, the resulting burst components will arrive differentially by $< 1~\mu$s to tens of ms and they will show different apparent dispersion measures, $\delta{\rm DM}_{\rm apparent} \sim 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Arrival time perturbations may mask any underlying periodicity with period $\lesssim 1$ s. When arrival times differ by less than the burst width, interference effects in dynamic spectra are expected. Strong lensing requires source sizes smaller than $({\rm Fresnel~scale)^2} / a$, which can be satisfied by compact objects such as neutron star magnetospheres but not by AGNs. Much of the phenomenology of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB121102 is similar to lensing effects. The overall picture can be tested by obtaining wideband spectra of bursts (from $<1$ to 10 GHz and possibly higher), which can also be used to characterize the plasma environment near FRB sources. A rich variety of phenomena is expected from an ensemble of lenses near the FRB source.

We show that the magnetic field in the source region should be at least 10^{14} Gauss. This strong field is required to ensure that the electrons have sufficiently high ground state Landau energy so that particle collisions, instabilities, and strong electric and magnetic fields associated with the FRB radiation do not perturb electrons' motion in the direction transverse to the magnetic field and destroy their coherent motion; coherence is required by the high observed brightness temperature of FRB radiation. The electric field in the source region required to sustain particle motion for a wave period is estimated to be of order 10^{11} esu. These requirements suggest that FRBs are produced near the surface of magnetars perhaps via forced reconnection of magnetic fields to produce episodic, repeated, outbursts. The beaming-corrected energy release in these bursts is estimated to be ~10^{36} ergs, whereas the total energy in the magnetic field is at least ~10^{45} ergs. We provide a number of predictions for this model which can be tested by future observations.

Furthermore, constraints can be placed on the SN ejecta mass and explosion energy, which appear to require a stripped envelope (Type Ib/c) SN and/or a very energetic explosion. A third FRB from this location would be even more constraining, allowing the component of the DM due to the SNR to be separated from the unchanging DM components due to the host galaxy and intergalactic medium. In the future, if more FRBs are found to repeat, the sort of arguments presented here can be used to test the young neutron star progenitor hypothesis for FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper we present (a) the predicted pulse widths of FRBs by considering two different scattering models, (b) the minimum total energy required to detect events, (c) the redshift distribution and (d) the detection rates of FRBs for the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA). The energy spectrum of FRBs is modelled as a power law with an exponent $-\alpha$ and our analysis spans a range $-3\leq \alpha \leq 5$. We find that OWFA will be capable of detecting FRBs with $\alpha\geq 0$. The redshift distribution and the event rates of FRBs are estimated by assuming two different energy distribution functions; a Delta function and a Schechter luminosity function with an exponent $-2\le \gamma \le 2$. We consider an empirical scattering model based on pulsar observations (model I) as well as a theoretical model (model II) expected for the intergalactic medium. The redshift distributions peak at a particular redshift $z_p$ for a fixed value of $\alpha$, which lie in the range $0.3\leq z_p \leq 1$ for the scattering model I and remain flat and extend up to high redshifts ($z\lesssim 5$) for the scattering model II.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1703.00394,"Christopher Thompson, ",Giant Primeval Magnetic Dipoles,"Macroscopic magnetic dipoles are considered as cosmic dark matter. Permanent magnetism in relativistic field structures can involve some form of superconductivity, one example being current-carrying string loops (`springs') with vanishing net tension. We derive the cross section for free classical dipoles to collide, finding it depends weakly on orientation when mutual precession is rapid. The collision rate of `spring' loops with tension ${\cal T} \sim 10^{-8}c^4/G$ in galactic halos approaches the measured rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) if the loops comprise most of the dark matter. A large superconducting dipole (LSD) with mass $\sim 10^{20}$ g and size $\sim 1$ mm will form a $\sim 100$ km magnetosphere moving through interstellar plasma. Although hydromagnetic drag is generally weak, it is strong enough to capture some LSDs into long-lived rings orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that form by the direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Repeated collisions near young SMBHs could dominate the global collision rate, thereby broadening the dipole mass spectrum. Colliding LSDs produce tiny, hot electromagnetic explosions. The accompanying paper shows that these explosions couple effectively to propagating low-frequency electromagnetic modes, with output peaking at 0.01-1 THz. We describe several constraints on, and predictions of, LSDs as cosmic dark matter. The shock formed by an infalling LSD triggers self-sustained thermonuclear burning in a C/O (ONeMg) white dwarf (WD) of mass $\gtrsim 1\,M_\odot$ ($1.3\,M_\odot$). The spark is generally located well off the center of the WD. The rate of LSD-induced explosions matches the observed rate of Type Ia supernovae.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1703.00393,"Christopher Thompson, ",Tiny Electromagnetic Explosions,"This paper considers electromagnetic transients of a modest total energy (${\cal E} \gtrsim 10^{40}$ erg) and small initial size (${\cal R} \gtrsim 10^{-1}$ cm). They could be produced during collisions between relativistic field structures (e.g. macroscopic magnetic dipoles) that formed around, or before, cosmic electroweak symmetry breaking. The outflowing energy has a dominant electromagnetic component; a subdominant thermal component (temperature $> 1$ GeV) supplies inertia in the form of residual $e^\pm$. A thin shell forms that expands subluminally, attaining a Lorentz factor $\sim 10^{6-7}$ before decelerating. Drag is supplied by the reflection of an ambient magnetic field, and by deflection of ambient free electrons. Emission of low-frequency (GHz-THz) superluminal waves takes place through three channels: i) reflection of the ambient magnetic field; ii) direct linear conversion of the embedded magnetic field into a superluminal mode; and iii) excitation outside the shell by corrugation of its surface. The escaping electromagnetic pulse is very narrow (a few wavelengths) and so the width of the detected transient is dominated by propagation effects. GHz radio transients are emitted from i) the dark matter halos of galaxies and ii) the near-horizon regions of supermassive black holes that formed by direct gas collapse and now accrete slowly. Brighter and much narrower 0.01-1 THz pulses are predicted at a rate at least comparable to fast radio bursts, experiencing weaker scattering and absorption. The same explosions also accelerate protons up to $\sim 10^{19}$ eV and heavier nuclei up to $10^{20-21}$ eV.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1702.08876,"Manjari Bagchi, ",A Unified Model for Repeating and Non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts,"The model that fast radio bursts are caused by plunges of asteroids onto neutron stars can explain both repetitive and non-repetitive bursts. If a neutron star passes through an asteroid belt around another star, there would be a series of bursts caused by series of asteroid impacts. Moreover, the neutron star would cross the same belt repetitively if it is in a binary with the star hosting the asteroid belt, leading to a repeated series of bursts. I explore the properties of neutron star binaries which could lead to the only known repetitive fast radio burst so far (FRB121102). In this model, the next two epochs of bursts are expected around 27-February-2017 and 18-December-2017.   On the other hand, if the asteroid belt is located around the neutron star itself, then a chance fall of an asteroid from that belt onto the neutron star would lead to a non-repetitive burst. Even a neutron star grazing an asteroid belt can lead to a non-repetitive burst caused by just one asteroid plunge during the grazing. This is possible even when the neutron star is in a binary with the asteroid hosting star, if the belt and the neutron star orbit are non-coplanar.",astro-ph.HE

Its large instantaneous field of view (FoV) and relative thermal insensitivity allow us to probe the ultra-bright tail of the FRB distribution, and to test a recent claim that this distribution's slope, $\alpha\equiv-\frac{\partial \log N}{\partial \log S}$, is quite small. A 256-input incoherent beamformer was deployed on the CHIME Pathfinder for this purpose. If the FRB distribution were described by a single power-law with $\alpha=0.7$, we would expect an FRB detection every few days, making this the fastest survey on sky at present. We collected 1268 hours of data, amounting to one of the largest exposures of any FRB survey, with over 2.4\,$\times$\,10$^5$\,deg$^2$\,hrs. Having seen no bursts, we have constrained the rate of extremely bright events to $<\!13$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above $\sim$\,220$\sqrt{(\tau/\rm ms)}$ Jy\,ms for $\tau$ between 1.3 and 100\,ms, at 400--800\,MHz. The non-detection also allows us to rule out $\alpha\lesssim0.9$ with 95$\%$ confidence, after marginalizing over uncertainties in the GBT rate at 700--900\,MHz, though we show that for a cosmological population and a large dynamic range in flux density, $\alpha$ is brightness-dependent. Since FRBs now extend to large enough distances that non-Euclidean effects are significant, there is still expected to be a dearth of faint events and relative excess of bright events. Nevertheless we have constrained the allowed number of ultra-intense FRBs. While this does not have significant implications for deeper, large-FoV surveys like full CHIME and APERTIF, it does have important consequences for other wide-field, small dish experiments.",astro-ph.HE

We study the information content in autocorrelation of the angular positions and dispersion measures (DM) and in cross-correlation with galaxies. We show that the cross-correlation with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies will place stringent constraints on the mean physical quantities associated with FRBs. If $\sim$10,000 FRBs are detected with $\lesssim \rm deg$ resolution in the SDSS field, the clustering analysis with the intrinsic DM scatter of $100\, {\rm pc}/{\rm cm}^3$ can constrain the global abundance of free electrons at $z\lt1$ and the large-scale bias of FRB host galaxies (the statistical relation between the distribution of host galaxies and cosmic matter density field) with fractional errors (with a $68\%$ confidence level) of $\sim10\%$ and $\sim20\%$, respectively. The mean near-source dispersion measure and the delay time distribution of FRB rates relative to the global star forming rate can be also determined by combining the clustering and the probability distribution function of DM. Our approach will be complementary to high-resolution ($\ll {\rm deg}$) event localization using e.g., VLA and VLBI for identifying the origin of FRBs and the source environment. We strongly encourage future observational programs such as CHIME, UTMOST, and HIRAX to survey FRBs in the SDSS field.",astro-ph.CO

We investigated constraints on the young neutron star (NS) model, that (a) the FRB intrinsic luminosity is supported by the spin-down energy, and (b) the FRB duration is shorter than the NS rotation period. In the case of a circular cone emission geometry, conditions (a) and (b) determine the NS parameters within very small ranges, compared with that from only condition (a) discussed in previous works. Anisotropy of the pulsed emission does not affect the area of the allowed parameter region by virtue of condition (b). The determined parameters are consistent with those independently limited by the properties of the possible persistent radio counterpart and the circumburst environments such as surrounding materials. Since the NS in the allowed parameter region is older than the spin-down timescale, the hypothetical GRP-like model expects a rapid radio flux decay of $\lesssim1$ Jy within a few years as the spin-down luminosity decreases. The continuous monitoring will give a hint of discrimination of the models.

arXiv:1702.02161,"J. I. Katz, ",FRB as Pulsar Lightning,"There are striking phenomenological similarities between Fast Radio Bursts and lightning in the Earth's and planetary atmospheres. Both have very low duty factors, $\lesssim 10^{-8}$--$10^{-5}$ for FRB and (very roughly) $\sim 10^{-4}$ for the main return strokes in an active thundercloud. Lightning occurs in an electrified insulating atmosphere when a conducting path is created by and permits current flow. FRB may occur in neutron star magnetospheres whose plasma is believed to be divided by vacuum gaps. Vacuum is a perfect insulator unless electric fields are sufficient for electron-positron pair production by curvature radiation, a high-energy analogue of electrostatic breakdown in an insulating gas. FRB may be ""electrars"" powered by the release of stored electrostatic energy, counterparts to Soft Gamma Repeaters powered by the release of stored magnetostatic energy (magnetars). This frees pulsar FRB models from the constraint that their power not exceed the instantaneous spin-down power. Energetic constraints imply that the sources of more energetic FRB have shorter spin-down lifetimes, perhaps shorter than the three years over which FRB 121102 has been observed to repeat.",astro-ph.HE

No FRBs were detected in the pointings observed through May 2016. We estimate a 95% confidence upper limit on the FRB rate of $3.6\times 10^3$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.63 Jy at 350 MHz for an intrinsic pulse width of 5 ms. We place constraints on the spectral index $\alpha$ by running simulations for different astrophysical scenarios and cumulative flux density distributions. The non-detection with GBNCC is consistent with the 1.4-GHz rate reported for the Parkes surveys for $\alpha > +0.35 $ in the absence of scattering and free-free absorption and $\alpha > -0.3$ in the presence of scattering, for a Euclidean flux distribution. The constraints imply that FRBs exhibit either a flat spectrum or a spectral turnover at frequencies above 400 MHz. These constraints also allow estimation of the number of bursts that can be detected with current and upcoming surveys. We predict that CHIME may detect anywhere from several to $\sim$50 FRBs a day (depending on model assumptions), making it well suited for interesting constraints on spectral index, the log $N$-log $S$ slope and pulse profile evolution across its bandwidth (400-800 MHz).",astro-ph.HE

Applying Bayesian inference to the data of 21 FRBs, we derive a relatively large mean host DM, i.e. $\left\langle{\rm DM_{HG,loc}}\right\rangle \sim 270~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ with a large dispersion. A relatively large ${\rm DM_{HG}}$ of FRBs is also supported by the millisecond scattering times of some FRBs and the relatively small redshift $z=0.19273$ of FRB 121102 (which gives ${\rm DM_{HG,loc}} \sim 210 ~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$). The large host galaxy DM may be contributed by the ISM or a near-source plasma in the host galaxy. If it is contributed by the ISM, the type of the FRB host galaxies would not be Milky Way (MW)-like, consistent with the detected host of FRB 121102.

While other possibilities are not ruled out, the emission properties are broadly consistent with Murase et al. (2016) that theoretically proposed quasi-steady radio emission as a counterpart of both FRBs and pulsar-driven supernovae. Here we constrain the model parameters of such a young neutron star scenario for FRB 121102. If the associated supernova has a conventional ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej}\gtrsim{\rm a \ few}\ M_\odot$, a neutron star with an age of $t_{\rm age} \sim 10-100 \ \rm yrs$, an initial spin period of $P_{i} \lesssim$ a few ms, and a dipole magnetic field of $B_{\rm dip} \lesssim {\rm a \ few} \times 10^{13} \ \rm G$ can be compatible with the observations. However, in this case, the magnetically-powered scenario may be favored as an FRB energy source because of the efficiency problem in the rotation-powered scenario. On the other hand, if the associated supernova is an ultra-stripped one or the neutron star is born by the accretion-induced collapse with $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.1 \ M_\odot$, a younger neutron star with $t_{\rm age} \sim 1-10$ yrs can be the persistent radio source and might produce FRBs with the spin-down power.

Fast radio bursts may be produced during the close periastron approach and at the process of the final binary merging. In the sufficiently dense star cluster the neutron stars collisions can be very frequent. Therefore, this model can explain in principle the observed recurrent (multiple) fast radio bursts, analogous to the observed ones from the source FRB 121102.

We show that the properties of the host galaxy are consistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were previously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of newly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation periods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario whereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar remnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements on the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta (accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula), energetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the quiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century. The quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the shock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the surrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar wind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow from an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be too young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time derivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent radio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such as searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after their explosions.",astro-ph.HE

At maximal efficiency, the instability timescale for a massive vector is milliseconds, potentially leading to a transient rate of energy extraction from a black hole in principle as large as $\sim 10^{55} \ {\rm erg \, s}^{-1}$.

A typical Galactic FRB would produce a millisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the radio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell phones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global array of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz communication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science downloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for and record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a central data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all participants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from an astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times reported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position, potentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating at diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield the dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within the Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz FM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower frequencies.

The magnetic field surrounding supermassive black holes that reside in galactic nuclei is of comparable or greater strength. Therefore, when the pulsar travels inside such regions, a non-negligible Lorentz force is experienced by the current sheets, which tends to pull them apart at the critical line. As breakage occurs, instabilities ensue that burst the bubble, allowing closed field lines to snap open and release large amounts of electromagnetic energy, sufficient to power fast radio bursts (FRBs).

The characteristic diameter of the beam emitter is estimated through a combination of energetic and engineering constraints, and both approaches intriguingly yield a similar result which is on the scale of a large rocky planet. Moreover, the optimal frequency for powering the light sail is shown to be similar to the detected FRB frequencies. These `coincidences' lend some credence to the possibility that FRBs might be artificial in origin. Other relevant quantities, such as the characteristic mass of the light sail, and the angular velocity of the beam, are also derived. By using the FRB occurrence rate, we infer upper bounds on the rate of FRBs from extragalactic civilizations in a typical galaxy. The possibility of detecting fainter signals is briefly discussed, and the wait time for an exceptionally bright FRB event in the Milky Way is estimated.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1701.01100,Shriharsh P. Tendulkar et al.,The Host Galaxy and Redshift of the Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102,"The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has provided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability $p\lesssim3\times10^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart and find that it is an extended ($0.6^{\prime\prime}-0.8^{\prime\prime}$) object displaying prominent Balmer and [OIII] emission lines. Based on the spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a low-metallicity, star-forming, $m_{r^\prime} = 25.1$ AB mag dwarf galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.19273(8)$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc. From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host galaxy to have a diameter $\lesssim4$ kpc and a stellar mass of $M_*\sim4-7\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to 3$\,M_\odot\,L_\odot^{-1}$. Based on the H$\alpha$ flux, we estimate the star formation rate of the host to be $0.4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and a substantial host dispersion measure depth $\lesssim 324\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. The net dispersion measure contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote et al (2017) is offset from the galaxy's center of light by $\sim$200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1701.01099,B. Marcote et al.,The Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102 as Seen on Milliarcsecond Angular Scales,"The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond localization (~ 100mas precision) of FRB121102 using the VLA has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European VLBI Network and the 305-m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a projected linear separation of < 40pc (< 12mas angular separation, at 95% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and persistent radio source (~ 2-4mas at 1.7GHz), which are both similar to the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a projected size constrained to be < 0.7pc (< 0.2mas angular extent at 5.0GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of T_b > 5 x 10^7K. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between FRB121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB121102 that best match the observed data.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1701.01098,S. Chatterjee et al.,The direct localization of a fast radio burst and its host,"Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger than any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted in an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180 uJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size less than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct sub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable associations.",astro-ph.HE

We provide an accessible reference for a number of simple, but critical, statistical questions relevant for current transient and FRB research and utilizing the negative binomial model for counts in which the count rate parameter is uncertain or randomly biased from one study to the next. We apply these methods to re-assess and update results from previous FRB surveys, finding as follows. 1) Thirteen FRBs detected across five high-Galactic-latitude (> 30$^\circ$) surveys are highly significant $(p = 5\times 10^{-5})$ evidence of a higher rate relative to the single FRB detected across four low-latitude (< 5$^\circ$) surveys, even after accounting for effects that dampen Galactic plane sensitivity. High- vs. mid-latitude (5 to 15$^\circ$) is marginally significant $(p = 0.03)$. 2) A meta analysis of twelve heterogeneous surveys gives an FRB rate of 2866 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above 1 Jy at high Galactic latitude (95% confidence 1121 to 7328) and 285 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at low/mid latitudes (95% from 48 to 1701). 3) Using the Parkes HTRU high-latitude setup requires 193 observing hours to achieve 50% probability of detecting an FRB and 937 hours to achieve 95% probability, based on the ten detections of (Champion et al. 2016) and appropriately accounting for uncertainty in the unknown Poisson rate. 4) Two quick detections at Parkes from a small number of high-latitude fields (Ravi et al. 2015; Petroff et al. 2015) tentatively favor a look long survey style relative to the scan wide HTRU survey, but only at $p = 0.07$ significance.",astro-ph.IM

(2016) discovered a gamma-ray transient, Swift J0644.5-5111, associated with the fast radio burst (FRB) 131104. They also reported follow-up broadband observations beginning two days after the FRB and provided upper limits on a putative afterglow of this transient. In this paper, we show that if such a transient drives a relativistic shock as in a cosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB), these upper limits are consistent with an environment of which density is much less than that of an interstellar medium but typical for the outskirts' density of a galaxy when the typical values of three microphysical parameters of the shock are taken. This appears to be inconsistent with the catastrophic event models in which the central engine of Swift J0644.5-5111 is surrounded by an interstellar medium, but together with the properties of the gamma-ray transient, favors the binary neutron star merger origin. We further constrain the physical parameters of the postmerger object by assuming that Swift J0644.5-5111 results from internal dissipation of a spinning-down pulsar wind, and we find that the postmerger object is an ultra-strongly magnetized, very rapidly rotating pulsar. This merger event should have given birth to a gravitational wave burst, an FRB, and a short GRB or an extended X-ray/gamma-ray emission if a relativistic jet of the GRB is missed.

We report on radio-continuum imaging observations of the original localization region of the FRB, beginning three days after the event and comprising 25 epochs over 2.5 yr. Besides probabilistic arguments that suggest that the association between the $\gamma$-ray transient and the FRB is not compelling, we provide upper limits on a putative radio afterglow of this transient that are at odds with standard models for its progenitor. We further report the discovery of an unusual variable radio source spatially and temporally coincident with FRB 131104, but not spatially coincident with the $\gamma$-ray event. The radio variable flares by a factor of $3$ above its long term average within $10$ d of the FRB at 7.5 GHz, with a factor-of-$2$ increase at $5.5$ GHz. Within our observations, the variable has persisted with only modest modulation and never approached the flux density observed in the days after the FRB.

arXiv:1611.03848,"Kohta Murase, Peter Meszaros, Derek B.

We show that even if these manifest in only a fraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including Swift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the energy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a magnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the intergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the required gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or extended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with the rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios, the prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to escape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a wind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB emission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio afterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated. Gravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests.",astro-ph.HE

The transient has duration $T_{90} \gtrsim 100$s and fluence $S_\gamma\approx 4\times 10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, increasing the energy budget for this event by more than a billion times; at the nominal $z\approx 0.55$ redshift implied by its dispersion measure, the burst's gamma-ray energy output is $E_\gamma \approx 5\times 10^{51}$ erg. The observed radio to gamma-ray fluence ratio for FRB131104 is consistent with a lower limit we derive from Swift observations of another FRB, which is not detected in gamma-rays, and with an upper limit previously derived for the brightest gamma-ray flare from SGR 1806-20, which was not detected in the radio. X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical observations beginning two days after the FRB do not reveal any associated afterglow, supernova, or transient; Swift observations exclude association with the brightest 65% of Swift gamma-ray burst X-ray afterglows, while leaving the possibility of an associated supernova at much more than 10% the FRB's nominal distance, $D\gtrsim 320$ Mpc, largely unconstrained. Transient high-luminosity gamma-ray emission arises most naturally in a relativistic outflow or shock breakout, as for example from magnetar flares, gamma-ray bursts, relativistic supernovae, and some types of galactic nuclear activity. Our discovery thus bolsters the case for an extragalactic origin for some FRBs and suggests that future rapid-response observations might identify long-lived counterparts, resolving the nature of these mysterious phenomena and realizing their promise as probes of cosmology and fundamental physics.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1611.03094,"Richard Lieu, ",Are fast radio bursts the birthmark of magnetars?,"A model of fast radio bursts, which enlists young, short period extragalactic magnetars satisfying $B/P > 2 \times 10^{16}$~G~s$^{-1}$ (1~G = 1~statvolt~cm$^{-1}$) as the source, is proposed. When the parallel component $\bE_\parallel$ of the surface electric field (under the scenario of a vacuum magnetosphere) of such pulsars approaches 5 \% of the critical field $E_c = m_e^2 c^3/(e\hbar)$, in strength, the field can readily decay via the Schwinger mechanism into electron-positron pairs, the back reaction of which causes $\bE_\parallel$ to oscillate on a characteristic timescale smaller than the development of a spark gap. Thus, under this scenario, the open field line region of the pulsar magnetosphere is controlled by Schwinger pairs, and their large creation and acceleration rates enable the escaping pairs to coherently emit radio waves directly from the polar cap. The majority of the energy is emitted at frequencies $\lesssim 1$~GHz where the coherent radiation has the highest yield, at a rate large enough to cause the magnetar to lose spin significantly over timescale $\ap$ a few $\times 10^{-3}$~s, the duration of a fast radio burst. Owing to circumstellar environment of a young magnetar, however, the $\lesssim 1$~GHz radiation is likely to be absorbed or reflected by the overlying matter. It is shown that the brightness of the remaining (observable) frequencies of $\ap 1$~GHz and above are on par with a typical fast radio burst. Unless some spin-up mechanism is available to recover the original high rotation rate that triggered the Schwinger mechanism, the fast radio burst will not be repeated again in the same magnetar.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1611.01243,"J. I. Katz, ",Are FRB Wandering Narrow Beams?,"It is generally assumed that the sources of Fast Radio Bursts radiate roughly isotropically, so that the observed low duty cycle of any individual source indicates a similar low duty cycle of its radio-frequency emission. An alternative hypothesis is that the radiative duty cycle is ${\cal O}(1)$, but that the radiation is emitted in a beam with a solid angle comparable to the observed duty cycle, whose direction wanders or sweeps across the sky. This hypothesis relaxes the extreme power demands of isotropically radiating models of FRB at the price of multiplying the number of sources. The constraints on pulsar models are relaxed; rather than being unprecedentedly fast-spinning and highly-magnetized with short spin-down times, their parameters may be closer to those of typical radio pulsars. The nanoshots of Galactic pulsars pose analogous energetic problems that may be resolved if their emission also is beamed, suggesting a relation between these phenomena, despite their vastly different energy scales.",astro-ph.HE

The NHPP, well-known in statistics, can model changes in the rate as a function of both astronomical features and the details of an observing campaign. This is particularly helpful for rare events like FRBs because the NHPP can combine information across surveys, making the most of all available information. The goal of the paper is two-fold. First, it is intended to be a tutorial on the use of the NHPP. Second, we build an NHPP model that incorporates beam patterns and a power law flux distribution for the rate of FRBs. Using information from 12 surveys including 15 detections, we find an all-sky FRB rate of 586.88 events per sky per day above a flux of 1 Jy (95\% CI: 271.86, 923.72) and a flux power-law index of 0.91 (95\% CI: 0.57, 1.25).

Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures.

arXiv:1610.00416,"Takashi J. Moriya, ",Radio transients from accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs,"We investigate observational properties of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs in radio frequencies. If AIC is triggered by accretion from a companion star, a dense circumstellar medium can be formed around the progenitor system. Then, the ejecta from AIC collide to the dense circumstellar medium, making a strong shock. The strong shock can produce synchrotron emission which can be observed in radio frequencies. Even if AIC occurs as a result of white dwarf mergers, we argue that AIC may cause fast radio bursts if a certain condition is satisfied. If AIC forms neutron stars which are so massive that rotation is required to support themselves (i.e., supramassive neutron stars), the supramassive neutron stars may immediately lose their rotational energy by the r-mode instability and collapse to black holes. If the collapsing supramassive neutron stars are strongly magnetized, they may emit fast radio bursts as previously suggested. The AIC radio transients from the single-degenerate systems may be detected in the future radio transient surveys like Very Large Array Sky Survey or the Square Kilometer Array transient survey. Because AIC is suggested to be a gravitational wave source, gravitational waves from AIC may be accompanied by radio-bright transients which can be used to confirm the AIC origin of observed gravitational waves.",astro-ph.HE

Under certain conditions, the synchrotron stimulated emission process can be more important than true absorption, and a synchrotron maser can be created.

The DMs reflect the density of the intracluster medium (ICM) including the WHIM. If we observe a sufficient number of FRBs in the direction of the cluster, we can derive the density profile from the DMs. Similarly, we can derive the pressure profile from the SZ effect. By combining the density and the pressure profiles, the temperature profile can be obtained. Based on mock observations of nearby clusters, we find that the density of the WHIM can be determined even at > 2 R_200 from the cluster center when FRB observations with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) become available.

In this paper, we consider the impacts of free-free absorption and multi-path scattering in our analysis via a number of different assumptions about the intervening medium. We consider previous low frequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology digital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as well as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-Time Analysis Experiment (HIRAX). We predict that CHIME and HIRAX will be able to observe $\sim$ 30 or more FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free absorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We also show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For CHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB distance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the FRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly cosmological sources, this effect may impact future surveys in this band, particularly if the FRB population traces the cosmic star formation rate.",astro-ph.HE

Methods of using measured DM and redshift $z$ to study cosmology have been proposed, but one needs to assume a certain amount of DM contribution from the host galaxy (DM$_{\rm HG}$) in order to apply those methods. We introduce a slope parameter $\beta(z) \equiv d \ln \left< {\rm DM}_{\rm E} \right> / d \ln z$ (where DM$_{\rm E}$ is the observed DM subtracting the Galactic contribution), which can be directly measured when a sample of FRBs have $z$ measured. We show that $\left< {\rm DM_{HG}}\right>$ can be roughly inferred from $\beta$ and the mean values, $\overline{\rm \left<DM_{\rm E}\right>}$ and $\bar z$, of the sample. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the mean value of local host galaxy DM, $\left<\rm{DM_{HG,loc}}\right>$, along with other cosmological parameters (mass density $\Omega_m$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the IGM portion of the baryon energy density $\Omega_b f_{\rm IGM}$) can be independently measured through MCMC fitting to the data.",astro-ph.HE

Photon mass limits have been earlier set through the optical emissions of the Crab Nebula pulsar, but we prove that these limits can be significantly improved with the dispersion measure (DM) measurements of radio pulsars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The combination of DM measurements of pulsars and distances of the Magellanic Clouds provide a strict upper limit on the photon mass as low as $m_{\gamma} \leq2.0\times10^{-45}~\rm{g}$, which is at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the constraint from the Crab Nebula pulsar. Although our limit is not as tight as the current best result ($\sim10^{-47}~\rm{g}$) from a fast radio burst (FRB 150418) at a cosmological distance, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 remains under debate; and our limit can reach the same high precision of FRB 150418 when it has an extragalactic origin ($\sim10^{-45}~\rm{g}$).",astro-ph.HE

We obtain 3194 and 272 GRPs occurring at the main pulse and the interpulse phases, respectively. A few GRPs detected at both 0.3 and 8.4 GHz are the most wide-band samples ever reported. In the frequency range from 0.3 to 2.2 GHz, we find that about 70\% or more of the GRP spectra are consistent with single power laws and the spectral indices of them are distributed from $-4$ to $-1$. We also find that a significant number of GRPs have such a hard spectral index (approximately $-1$) that the fluence at 0.3 GHz is below the detection limit (""dim-hard"" GRPs). Stacking light curves of such dim-hard GRPs at 0.3 GHz, we detect consistent enhancement compared to the off-GRP light curve. Our samples show apparent correlations between the fluences and the spectral hardness, which indicates that more energetic GRPs tend to show softer spectra. Our comprehensive studies on the GRP spectra are useful materials to verify the GRP model of fast radio bursts in future observations.",astro-ph.HE

These RRATs could have an extragalactic origin and therefore be Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The sizes of related galaxies on the sky at such short distances are comparable to the beam size of a single-dish telescope (for example, the $7.0'$ radius of the Parkes beam). Hence the association, if found, could be more definitive as compared to finding host galaxies for more distant FRBs. We did not find any host galaxy associated with six RRATs near the maximum Galactic DM. This result is consistent with the fact that the probability of finding an FRB host galaxy within this volume is also very small.

To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter broadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density fluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a short-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly supersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of shock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the required density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the scattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with efficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling of the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies in different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the major origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the total DM. We also find that the sheet-like structure of density in the host ISM associated with folded magnetic fields in a viscosity-dominated regime of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot give rise to strong scattering. Furthermore, valuable insights into the IGM turbulence concerning the detailed spatial structure of density and magnetic field can be gained from the observed scattering timescale of FRBs. Our results are in favor of the suppression of micro-plasma instabilities and the validity of collisional-MHD description of turbulence properties in the collisionless IGM.",astro-ph.HE

Photon mass upper limits have been earlier set through pulsar observations, but new investigations are offered by the excess of dispersion measure (DM) sometimes observed with pulsar and magnetar data at low frequencies, or with the fast radio bursts (FRBs), of yet unknown origin. Arguments for the excess of DM do not reach a consensus, but are not mutually exclusive. Thus, we remind that for massive electromagnetism, dispersion goes as the inverse of the frequency squared. Thereby, new avenues are offered also by the recently operating ground observatories in 10-80 MHz domain and by the proposed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio astronomy (OLFAR). The latter acts as a large aperture dish by employing a swarm of nano-satellites observing the sky for the first time in the 0.1 - 15 MHz spectrum.

HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid and will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has two primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at high redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe unresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line (`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at redshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). HIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by observing a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift range) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the universe transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a hydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing the sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern Hemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with large-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand square degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way galaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio transients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and eXperimentciently detect transient events.

Our goal is to develop automated methods that can identify events of interest buried within the larger data stream. The V-FASTR fast transient system was designed to detect rare fast radio bursts (FRBs) within data collected by the Very Long Baseline Array. The resulting event candidates constitute a significant burden in terms of subsequent human reviewing time. We have trained and deployed a machine learning classifier that marks each candidate detection as a pulse from a known pulsar, an artifact due to radio frequency interference, or a potential new discovery. The classifier maintains high reliability by restricting its predictions to those with at least 90% confidence. We have also implemented several efficiency and usability improvements to the V-FASTR web-based candidate review system. Overall, we found that time spent reviewing decreased and the fraction of interesting candidates increased.

arXiv:1606.06795,H. K. Vedantham et al.,The Fluence and Distance Distributions of Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRB) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with apparent extragalactic origins. All but two of the FRBs have been discovered using the Parkes dish which employs multiple beams formed by an array of feed horns on its focal plane. In this paper, we show that (i) the preponderance of multiple-beam detections, and (ii) the detection rates for varying dish diameters, can be used to infer the index $\alpha$ of the cumulative fluence distribution function (the log$N$-log$F$ function: $\alpha=1.5$ for a non-evolving population in a Euclidean universe). If all detected FRBs arise from a single progenitor population, multiple-beam FRB detection rates from the Parkes telescope yield the constraint $0.52<\alpha<1.0$ with $90$% confidence. Searches at other facilities with different dish sizes refine the constraint to $0.66<\alpha<0.96$. Our results favor FRB searches with smaller dishes, because for $\alpha<1$, the gain in field-of-view for a smaller dish is more important than the reduction in sensitivity. Further, our results suggest that (i) FRBs are not standard candles, and (ii) the distribution of distances to the detected FRBs is weighted towards larger distances. If FRBs are extragalactic, these results are consistent with a cosmological population, which would make FRBs excellent probes of the baryonic content and geometry of the Universe.",astro-ph.HE

We use all V-FASTR data through February 2015 to report V-FASTR's upper limits on the rates of FRBs, and compare these with re-derived rates from Parkes FRB detection experiments. V-FASTR's operation at lambda=20 cm allows direct comparison with the 20 cm Parkes rate, and we derive a power-law limit of \gamma<-0.4 (95% confidence limit) on the index of FRB source counts, N(>S)\propto S^\gamma. Using the previously measured FRB rate and the unprecedented amount of survey time spent searching for FRBs at a large range of wavelengths (0.3 cm > \lambda > 90 cm), we also place frequency-dependent limits on the spectral distribution of FRBs. The most constraining frequencies place two-point spectral index limits of \alpha_{20cm}^{4cm} < 5.8 and \alpha_{90cm}^{20cm} > -7.6, where fluence F \propto f^\alpha if we assume true the burst rate reported by Champion et al. (2016) of R(F~0.6 Jy ms) = 7 x 10^3 sky^{-1} day^{-1} (for bursts of ~3 ms duration). This upper limit on \alpha suggests that if FRBs are extragalactic but non-cosmological, that on average they are not experiencing excessive free-free absorption due to a medium with high optical depth (assuming temperature ~8,000 K), which excessively invert their low-frequency spectrum. This in turn implies that the dispersion of FRBs arises in either or both of the intergalactic medium or the host galaxy, rather than from the source itself.",astro-ph.HE

These surveys originally targeted the Magellanic Clouds (in two cases) and unidentified gamma-ray sources at mid-Galactic latitudes (in the third case) for new radio pulsars. In previous processing, none of these surveys were searched to such a high DM limit. The surveys had a combined total of 719 hr of Parkes multibeam on-sky time. One known FRB, 010724, was present in our data and was detected in our analysis but no new FRBs were found. After adding in the on-sky Parkes time from these three surveys to the on-sky time (7512 hr) from the five Parkes surveys analysed by Rane et al., all of which have now been searched to high DM limits, we improve the constraint on the all-sky rate of FRBs above a fluence level of 3.8 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz to $R = 3.3^{+3.7}_{-2.2} \times 10^{3}$ events per day per sky (at the 99% confidence level).

Cordes et al.,Radio Wave Propagation and the Provenance of Fast Radio Bursts,"We analyze plasma dispersion and scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to identify the dominant locations of free electrons along their lines of sight and thus constrain the distances of the burst sources themselves. We establish the average $\tau$-DM relation for Galactic pulsars and use it as a benchmark for discussing FRB scattering. Though scattering times $\tau$ for FRBs are large in the majority of the 17 events we analyze, they are systematically smaller than those of Galactic pulsars that have similar dispersion measures (DMs). The lack of any correlation between $\tau$ and DM for FRBs suggests that the intergalactic medium (IGM) cannot account for both $\tau$ and DM. We therefore consider mixed models involving the IGM and host galaxies. If the IGM contributes significantly to DM while host galaxies dominate $\tau$, the scattering deficit with respect to the mean Galactic trend can be explained with a $\tau$-DM relation in the host that matches that for the Milky Way. However, it is possible that hosts dominate both $\tau$ and DM, in which case the observed scattering deficits require free electrons in the host to be less turbulent than in the Galaxy, such as if they are in hot rather than warm ionized regions. Our results imply that distances or redshifts of FRB sources can be significantly overestimated if they are based on the assumption that the extragalactic portion of DM is dominated by the IGM.",astro-ph.HE

Induction heating by pulsar waves revisited,"We investigate the evaporation of close-by pulsar companions, such as planets, asteroids, and white dwarfs, by induction heating. Assuming that the outflow energy is dominated by a Poynting flux (or pulsar wave) at the location of the companions, we calculate their evaporation timescales, by applying the Mie theory. Depending on the size of the companion compared to the incident electromagnetic wavelength, the heating regime varies and can lead to a total evaporation of the companion. In particular, we find that inductive heating is mostly inefficient for small pulsar companions, although it is generally considered the dominant process. Small objects like asteroids can survive induction heating for $10^4\,$years at distances as small as $1\,R_\odot$ from the neutron star. For degenerate companions, induction heating cannot lead to evaporation and another source of heating (likely by kinetic energy of the pulsar wind) has to be considered. It was recently proposed that bodies orbiting pulsars are the cause of fast radio bursts; the present results explain how those bodies can survive in the pulsar's highly energetic environment.",astro-ph.HE

Magnetar giant flares, driven by the reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, however, can produce both contemporaneous bursts at other wavelengths as well as afterglow-like emission. We conclude that the best chances are: (i) prompt short GRB-like emission; (ii) a contemporaneous optical flash that can reach naked eye peak luminosity (but only for a few milliseconds); (iii) a high energy afterglow emission. Case (i) could be tested by coordinated radio and high-energy experiments. Case (ii) could be seen in a coordinated radio-optical surveys, \eg\ by the Palomar Transient Factory in a 60-second frame as a transient object of $m=15-20$ magnitude with an expected optical detection rate of about 0.1~hr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than in radio. Shallow, but large-area sky surveys such as ASAS-SN and EVRYSCOPE could also detect prompt optical flashes from the more powerful Lorimer-burst clones.

Strong lensing of an FRB by a lens of mass $M_L$ induces two images, separated by a typical time delay $\sim$ few $\times(M_L/30\, M_\odot)$ milliseconds. Considering the expected FRB detection rate by upcoming experiments, such as CHIME, of $10^4$ FRBs per year, we should observe from tens to hundreds of repeated bursts yearly, if MACHOs in this window make up all the dark matter.

When the WD fills its Roche lobe, mass transfer will occur from the WD to the NS through the inner Lagrange point. The accreted magnetized materials may trigger magnetic reconnection when they approach the NS surface, and therefore the electrons can be accelerated to an ultra-relativistic speed. In this scenario, the curvature radiation of the electrons moving along the NS magnetic field lines can account for the characteristic frequency and the timescale of an FRB. Owing to the conservation of angular momentum, the WD may be kicked away after a burst, and the next burst may appear when the system becomes semi-detached again through the gravitational radiation. By comparing our analyses with the observations, we show that such an intermittent Roche lobe overflow mechanism can be responsible for the observed repeating behavior of FRB 121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1604.04909,"Anthony L. Piro, ",The Impact of a Supernova Remnant on Fast Radio Bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond bursts of radio radiation whose progenitors so far remain mysterious. Nevertheless, the timescales and energetics of the events have lead to many theories associating FRBs with young neutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young supernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational consequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into the interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back through the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM) associated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is high are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on the mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies of $400\,{\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\,{\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\sim100-500\,{\rm yrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high enough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs are powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the NS must have a magnetic field $\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ to ensure that it does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at radio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs and their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be constrained.",astro-ph.HE

We also compare this limit with the spectral energy distribution of the 2004 giant flare of the magnetar SGR 1806-20.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, we apply photons from three kinds of cosmic transients, including TeV blazars, gamma-ray bursts as well as fast radio bursts to constrain EEP.

Scholz et al.,The repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102: Multi-wavelength observations and additional bursts,"We report on radio and X-ray observations of the only known repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102. We have detected six additional radio bursts from this source: five with the Green Bank Telescope at 2 GHz, and one at 1.4 GHz at the Arecibo Observatory for a total of 17 bursts from this source. All have dispersion measures consistent with a single value ($\sim559$ pc cm$^{-3}$) that is three times the predicted maximum Galactic value. The 2-GHz bursts have highly variable spectra like those at 1.4 GHz, indicating that the frequency structure seen across the individual 1.4 and 2-GHz bandpasses is part of a wideband process. X-ray observations of the FRB 121102 field with the Swift and Chandra observatories show at least one possible counterpart; however, the probability of chance superposition is high. A radio imaging observation of the field with the Jansky Very Large Array at 1.6 GHz yields a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.3 mJy on any point-source continuum emission. This upper limit, combined with archival WISE 22-$\mu$m and IPHAS H$\alpha$ surveys, rules out the presence of an intervening Galactic HII region. We update our estimate of the FRB detection rate in the PALFA survey to be 1.1$^{+3.7}_{-1.0} \times 10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ (95% confidence) for peak flux density at 1.4 GHz above 300 mJy.

We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on the role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating neutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular properties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and radio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of >10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio emission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be detected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible counterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of bursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead to a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the shocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the nebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to short-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes. Possible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission. (iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to afterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario, this burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc) high-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the subsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA.

Highly energetic radio pulses of millisecond duration, FRBs are observed with dispersion measures consistent with an extragalactic source. A variety of models have been proposed to explain their origin. One popular class of theorized FRB progenitor is the coalescence of compact binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black holes. Such coalescence events are strong gravitational-wave emitters. We demonstrate that measurements made by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories can be leveraged to severely constrain the validity of FRB binary coalescence models. Existing measurements constrain the binary black hole rate to approximately $5\%$ of the FRB rate, and results from Advanced LIGO's O1 and O2 observing runs may place similarly strong constraints on the fraction of FRBs due to binary neutron star and neutron star--black hole progenitors.",astro-ph.HE

(2016) reported their detections of sixteen additional bright bursts from the direction of the fast radio burst (FRB) 121102. This repeating FRB is inconsistent with all the catastrophic event models put forward previously for hypothetically non-repeating FRBs. Here we propose a different model, in which highly magnetized pulsars travel through asteroid belts of other stars. We show that a repeating FRB could originate from such a pulsar encountering lots of asteroids in the belt. During each pulsar-asteroid impact, an electric field induced outside the asteroid has such a large component parallel to the stellar magnetic field that electrons are torn off the asteroidal surface and accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies instantaneously. Subsequent movement of these electrons along magnetic field lines will cause coherent curvature radiation, which can account for all the properties of an FRB. In addition, this model can self-consistently explain the typical duration, luminosity, and repetitive rate of the seventeen bursts of FRB 121102. The predicted occurrence rate of repeating FRB sources may imply that our model would be testable in the next few years.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1603.05509,"Brian Punsly, Donato Bini, ",General Relativistic Considerations of the Field Shedding Model of Fast Radio Bursts,"Popular models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) involve the gravitational collapse of neutron star progenitors to black holes. It has been proposed that the shedding of the strong neutron star magnetic field ($B$) during the collapse is the power source for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized the simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the magnetic flux is magnetic ""hair"" that must be shed before final collapse. But, neutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr Newman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon. In this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of the electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black hole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will not operate due to pair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we find that for a neutron star with $B = 10^{11} - 10^{13}$ G and a long rotation period, $>1$ s this is not a concern. We also discuss the observational evidence supporting the plausibility of magnetic flux shedding models of FRBs that are spawned from rapidly rotating progenitors.",astro-ph.HE

(2016) have recently reported the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB150418, with a promising radio counterpart at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz -- a rapidly decaying source, falling from 200-300 $\mu$Jy to 100 $\mu$Jy on timescales of $\sim$6 d. This transient source may be associated with an elliptical galaxy at redshift $z=0.492$, providing the first firm spectroscopic redshift for a FRB and the ability to estimate the density of baryons in the intergalactic medium via the combination of known redshift and radio dispersion of the FRB. An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger (2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN. The putative counterpart's variation may then instead be extrinsic, caused by refractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way, which would invalidate the association with FRB150418. We examine this latter explanation in detail and show that the reported observations are consistent with scintillating radio emission from the core of a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) having a brightness temperature $T_{\rm b} \gtrsim 10^9 {\rm K}$. Using numerical simulations of the expected scattering for the line of sight to FRB150418, we provide example images and light curves of such an AGN at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz. These results can be compared with continued radio monitoring to conclusively determine the importance of scintillation for the observed radio variability, and they show that scintillation is a critical consideration for continued searches for FRB counterparts at radio wavelengths.",astro-ph.HE

We report follow-up radio and optical observations of the afterglow candidate and find a source that is consistent with an active galactic nucleus. If the afterglow candidate is nonetheless a prototypical FRB afterglow, existing slow-transient surveys limit the fraction of FRBs that produce afterglows to 0.25 for afterglows with fractional variation, $m=2|S_1-S_2|/(S_1+S_2)\geq0.7$, and 0.07 for $m\geq1$, at 95% confidence.

To examine the expected performance of extreme low-latency search pipelines, we simulate a population of coalescing BNSs and use these to estimate the detectability and localisation efficiency at different times before merger. Using observational SGRB flux data corrected to the range of the advanced GW interferometric detectors, we determine what EM observations could be achieved from low-frequency radio up to high energy $\gamma$-ray.

FRBs are extra-Galactic events coming from distances $d \lesssim 100$ Mpc. Most of the dispersion measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected SNR shell; for a given burst the DM should decrease with time. FRBs are not expected to be seen below $\sim 300 $ MHz due to free-free absorption in the expanding ejecta. A supernova might have been detected years before the burst; FRBs are mostly associated with star forming galaxies.   The model requires that some pulsars are born with very fast spins, of the order of few milliseconds. The observed distribution of spin-down powers $\dot{E}$ in young energetic pulsars is consistent with equal birth rate per decade of $\dot{E}$. Accepting this injection spectrum and scaling the intrinsic brightness of FRBs with $\dot{E}$, we predict the following properties of a large sample of FRBs: (i) the brightest observed events come from a broad distribution in distances; (ii) for repeating bursts brightness either remains nearly constant (if the spin-down time is longer than the age of the pulsar) or decreases with time otherwise; in the latter case DM $\propto \dot{E}$.",astro-ph.HE

We show that coherent curvature radiation from these electrons moving along magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere of the other NS is responsible for the observed FRB signal, that is, the characteristic emission frequency, luminosity, duration and event rate of FRBs can be well understood. In addition, we discuss several implications of this model, including double-peaked FRBs and possible associations of FRBs with short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events.",astro-ph.HE

More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an extragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs. Clusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range $23.5 - 86.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $0.172 - 3.901$ s. The new pulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object. We estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for bursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all new discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics of the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are drawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period distribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of canonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a periodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful complement to periodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population that has so far been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic pulsar population models.",astro-ph.HE

The apparent non-repeating nature of the fast radio bursts has led several authors to hypothesise that they originate in cataclysmic astrophysical events. Here we report the detection of ten additional bursts from the direction of FRB121102, using the 305-m Arecibo telescope. These new bursts have dispersion measures and sky positions consistent with the original burst. This unambiguously identifies FRB121102 as repeating and demonstrates that its source survives the energetic events that cause the bursts. Additionally, the bursts from FRB121102 show a wide range of spectral shapes that appear to be predominantly intrinsic to the source and which vary on timescales of minutes or shorter.

The dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 150418 is known to $\sim 0.1$%, and there is a claim to have measured its redshift with an accuracy of $\sim 2$%, but the strength of the constraint on $m_\gamma$ is limited by uncertainties in the modelling of the host galaxy and the Milky Way, as well as possible inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Allowing for these uncertainties, the recent data on FRB 150418 indicate that $m_\gamma \lesssim 1.8 \times 10^{-14}$eV c$^{-2}$ ($3.2 \times 10^{-50}$kg), if FRB 150418 indeed has a redshift $z = 0.492$ as initially reported. In the future, the different redshift dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to DM can be used to improve the sensitivity to $m_\gamma$ if more FRB redshifts are measured. For a fixed fractional uncertainty in the extra-galactic contribution to the DM of an FRB, one with a lower redshift would provide greater sensitivity to $m_\gamma$.",astro-ph.HE

They use this localization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z ~ 0.49 that exhibits no discernable star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient.

These limits on differential post-Newtonian parameters ($\Delta \gamma<2.52\times10^{-8}$) are the best yet achieved but still rely on uncertain assumptions, namely the relative contributions of dispersion and gravitational delays to the observed time delays and the distances to FRBs. Also very recently, the first FRB host galaxy has likely been identified, providing the first redshift-based distance estimate to FRB 150418 \citep{kea16}. Moreover, consistency between the \omegaigm\ estimate from FRB 150418 and \omegaigm~expected from $\Lambda$CDM models and WMAP observations leads one to conclude that the observed time delay for FRB 150418 is highly dominated by dispersion, with any gravitational delays small contributors. This points to even tighter limits on $\Delta \gamma$. In this paper, the technique of \citet{wei15} is applied to FRB 150418 to produce a limit of $\Delta \gamma < 1 - 2\times10^{-9}$, approximately an order of magnitude better than previous limits and in line with expectations by \citet{wei15} for what could be achieved if the dispersive delay is separated from other effects.

While every fast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a redshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial coordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the identification of a fading radio transient lasting $\sim 6$ days after the event, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's redshift to be $z=0.492\pm0.008$. The dispersion measure and redshift, in combination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium of $\Omega_{\mathrm{IGM}}=4.9 \pm 1.3\%$, in agreement with the expectation from WMAP, and including all of the so-called ""missing baryons"". The $\sim6$-day transient is largely consistent with a short gamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support progenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae.

After examining the dependencies on the specific charge of the particle and the spin and charge of the KNBH, we conclude that the resulting timescale and radiation mechanism fit well with the extant observations of FRBs. Furthermore, we argue that the merger of a KNBH binary is one of the plausible central engines for potential gamma-ray or radio afterglow following a certain FRBs, and can also account for gravitational wave (GW) events like GW 150914.

Their energy released in radio band spans about two orders of magnitude, with a mean value of $\sim 10^{39}$ ergs.

If extragalactic, as suggested by their relative large dispersion measures, their brightness temperatures must be extremely high. Some FRB models (e.g. young pulsar model, magnetar giant flare model, or supra-massive neutron star collapse model) suggest that they may be associated with a synchrotron nebula. Here we study a synchrotron-heating process by an FRB in a self-absorbed synchrotron nebula. If the FRB frequency is below the synchrotron self-absorption frequency of the nebula, electrons in the nebula would absorb FRB photons, leading to a harder electron spectrum and enhanced self-absorbed synchrotron emission. In the meantime, the FRB flux is absorbed by the nebula electrons. We calculate the spectra of FRB-heated synchrotron nebulae, and show that the nebula spectra would show a significant hump in several decades near the self-absorption frequency. Identifying such a spectral feature would reveal an embedded FRB in a synchrotron nebula.",astro-ph.HE

If at least one of the two merging black holes carries certain amount of charge, possibly retained by a rotating magnetosphere, the inspiral of a BH-BH system would drive a global magnetic dipole normal to the orbital plane. The rapidly evolving magnetic moment during the merging process would drive a Poynting flux with an increasing wind power. The magnetospheric activities during the final phase of the merger would make a fast radio burst (FRB) if the BH charge can be as large as a factor of $\hat q \sim (10^{-9}-10^{-8})$ of the critical charge $Q_c$ of the BH. At large radii, dissipation of the Poynting flux energy in the outflow would power a short duration high-energy transient, which would appear as a detectable short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) if the charge can be as large as $\hat q \sim (10^{-5}-10^{-4})$. The putative short GRB coincident with GW 150914 recorded by Fermi GBM may be interpreted with this model.

The DM through the cosmic web is dominated by contributions from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in filaments and from the gas in voids. On the other hand, RM is induced mostly by the hot medium in galaxy clusters, and only a fraction of it is produced in the WHIM. We show that if one excludes FRBs whose sightlines pass through galaxy clusters, the line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments, $B_{||}$, is approximately $C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$, where $C$ is a known constant. Here, the redshift of the FRB is not required to be known; $f_{DM}$ is the fraction of total DM due to the WHIM, while $\langle 1+z \rangle$ is the redshift of interevening gas weighted by the WHIM gas density, both of which can be evaluated for a given cosmology model solely from the DM of an FRB. Using data on structure formation simulations and a model IGMF, we show that $C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$ closely reproduces the density-weighted line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments of the large-scale structure.",astro-ph.CO

The transition to the third branch can be reached by a pure hadronic neutron star through an induced collapse releasing energy that corresponds to a mass-energy difference between the second and third branch configurations.

Insights from polarisation measurements,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration broadband radio transients, the emission mechanisms of which are not understood. Masui et al. recently presented Green Bank Telescope observations of FRB 110523, which displayed temporal variation of the linear polarisation position angle (PA). This effect is commonly seen in radio pulsars and is attributed to a changing projected magnetic field orientation in the emission region as the star rotates. If a neutron star is the progenitor of this FRB, and the emission mechanism is pulsar-like, we show that the progenitor is either rapidly rotating, or the emission originates from a region of complex magnetic field geometry. The observed PA variation could also be caused by propagation effects within a neutron-star magnetosphere, or by spatially varying magnetic fields if the progenitor lies in a dense, highly magnetised environment. Although we urge caution in generalising results from FRB 110523 to the broader FRB population, our analysis serves as a guide to interpreting future polarisation measurements of FRBs, and presents another means of elucidating the origins of these enigmatic ephemera.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1601.05410,Apurba Bera et al.,On modelling the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population and event rate predictions,"Assuming that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are of extragalactic origin, we have developed a formalism to predict the FRB detection rate and the redshift distribution of the detected events for a telescope with given parameters. We have adopted FRB 110220, for which the emitted pulse energy is estimated to be $E_0 = 5.4 \times 10^{33}J$, as the reference event. The formalism requires us to assume models for (1) pulse broadening due to scattering in the ionized inter-galactic medium - we consider two different models for this, (2) the frequency spectrum of the emitted pulse - we consider a power law model $E_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $-5 \leq \alpha \leq 5$, and (3) the comoving number density of the FRB occurrence rate $n(E,w_i,z)$ - we ignore the z dependence and assume a fixed intrinsic pulse width $w_i = 1$ms for all the FRBs. The distribution of the emitted pulse energy $E$ is modelled through (a) a delta-function where all the FRBs have the same energy $E = E_0$ , and (b) a Schechter luminosity function where the energies have a spread around $E_0$. The models are all normalized using the 4 FRBs detected by Thornton et al. (2013). Our model predictions for the Parkes telescope are all consistent with the inferred redshift distribution of the fourteen FRBs detected there to date. We also find that scattering places an upper limit on the redshift of the FRBs detectable by a given telescope; for the Parkes telescope this is $z \sim 2$. Considering the upcoming Ooty Wide Field Array, we predict a FRB detection rate of $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 10^3$ per day.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1601.04051,"Liam Connor, Ue-Li Pen, Niels Oppermann, ",FRB repetition and non-Poissonian statistics,"We discuss some of the claims that have been made regarding the statistics of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In an earlier paper \citep{2015arXiv150505535C} we conjectured that flicker noise associated with FRB repetition could show up in non-cataclysmic neutron star emission models, like supergiant pulses. We show how the current limits of repetition would be significantly weakened if their repeat rate really were non-Poissonian and had a pink or red spectrum. Repetition and its statistics have implications for observing strategy, generally favouring shallow wide-field surveys, since in the non-repeating scenario survey depth is unimportant. We also discuss the statistics of the apparent latitudinal dependence of FRBs, and offer a simple method for calculating the significance of this effect. We provide a generalized Bayesian framework for addressing this problem, which allows for direct model comparison. It is shown how the evidence for a steep latitudinal gradient of the FRB rate is less strong than initially suggested and simple explanations like increased scattering and sky temperature in the plane are sufficient to decrease the low-latitude burst rate, given current data. The reported dearth of bursts near the plane is further complicated if FRBs have non-Poissonian repetition, since in that case the event rate inferred from observation depends on observing strategy.",astro-ph.HE

In this paper, constraints are obtained on flares from coronae of nearby stars. It is shown that the radio pulses with the observed power could not be generated if the plasma density within and in the nearest vicinity of the source is as high as it is necessary in order to provide the observed dispersion measure.

The axion stars are distorted by the forces so that they become like long sticks when they are close to the neutron stars. Although the tidal forces fairly distort the axion stars, our model is still consistent with present observations.

The sudden release of magnetic energy in a neutron star magnetosphere, as in popular models of SGR, can meet the energy requirements of FRB but requires both the presence of magnetospheric plasma in order that dissipation occur in a transparent region and a mechanism for releasing much of that energy quickly. FRB sources and SGR are distinguished by long-lived (up to thousands of years) current-carrying coronal arches remaining from formation of the young neutron star and their decay ends the phase of SGR/AXP/FRB activity even though ""magnetar"" fields may persist. Runaway increase in resistance when the current density exceeds a threshold releases magnetostatic energy in a sudden burst and produces high brightness GHz emission of FRB by a coherent process; SGR are produced when released energy thermalizes as an equilibrium pair plasma. Failures of some alternative FRB models and the non-detection of SGR~1806-20 at radio frequencies are discussed in appendices.",astro-ph.HE

Vieyro, ",A mechanism for fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts are mysterious transient sources likely located at cosmological distances. The derived brightness temperatures exceed by many orders of magnitude the self-absorption limit of incoherent synchrotron radiation, implying the operation of a coherent emission process. We propose a radiation mechanism for fast radio bursts where the emission arises from collisionless Bremsstrahlung in strong plasma turbulence excited by relativistic electron beams. We discuss possible astrophysical scenarios in which this process might operate. The emitting region is a turbulent plasma hit by a relativistic jet, where Langmuir plasma waves produce a concentration of intense electrostatic soliton-like regions (cavitons). The resulting radiation is coherent and, under some physical conditions, can be polarised and have a power-law distribution in energy. We obtain radio luminosities in agreement with the inferred values for fast radio bursts. The timescale of the radio flare in some cases can be extremely fast, of the order of $10^{-3}$ s.

FRBs exhibit dispersion consistent with propagation through a cold plasma and dispersion measures indicative of an origin at cosmological distances. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo simulations of a cosmological population of FRBs, based on assumptions consistent with observations of their energy distribution, their spatial density as a function of redshift and the properties of the interstellar and intergalactic media. We examine whether the dispersion measures, fluences, inferred redshifts, signal-to-noises and effective widths of known FRBs are consistent with a cosmological population.

We identify single pulse events reported in the literature which have never been seen to repeat, and which have been labelled as RRATs, but are potentially mis-labelled FRBs. We examine the probability that such `grey area' events are within the Milky Way.

The inferred all-sky burst rate is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate out to redshift 0.5. If the observed dispersion measures are assumed to be dominated by the intergalactic medium, the sources are at cosmological distances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1. These parameters are consistent with a wide range of source models. One fast radio burst showed circular polarization [21(7)%] of the radio emission, but no linear polarization was detected, and hence no Faraday rotation measure could be determined. Here we report the examination of archival data revealing Faraday rotation in a newly detected burst - FRB 110523. It has radio flux at least 0.6 Jy and dispersion measure 623.30(5) pc cm$^{-3}$. Using Galactic contribution 45 pc cm$^{-3}$ and a model of intergalactic electron density, we place the source at a maximum redshift of 0.5. The burst has rotation measure -186.1(1.4) rad m$^{-2}$, much higher than expected for this line of sight through the Milky Way and the intergalactic medium, indicating magnetization in the vicinity of the source itself or within a host galaxy. The pulse was scattered by two distinct plasma screens during propagation, which requires either a dense nebula associated with the source or a location within the central region of its host galaxy. Keeping in mind that there may be more than one type of fast radio burst source, the detection in this instance of source-local magnetization and scattering favours models involving young stellar populations such as magnetars over models involving the mergers of older neutron stars, which are more likely to be located in low density regions of the host galaxy.",astro-ph.HE

Here we investigate FRB121102, detected at Arecibo telescope and remarkable for its unusually large spectral index. After extensive study we conclude that the spectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. We find that putative nebula must lie beyond the Milky Way. We conclude that FRBs are of extra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. The challenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of FRBs. This high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellar deaths. Hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likely progenitors. Some of the consequences are: (i) Intergalactic FRB models can be safely ignored. (ii) The rich ISM environment of young magnetars can result in significant contribution to DM, Rotation Measure (RM) and in some cases to significant free-free optical depth. (iii) The star-forming regions in the host galaxies can contribute significantly to the DM. Including this contribution reduces the inferred distances to FRBs and correspondingly increases the volumetric rate of FRBs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can also produce FRBs). (iv) FRBs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies. Conversely, searching for FRBs at higher frequencies (2-5 GHz) would be attractive. (v) The blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergo rapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case for FRB121102), leading to X-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission. (vi) Galaxies with high star formation rate host will have a higher FRB rate. However, such FRBs will have differing DMs owing to differing local contributions.

We formed images with 2 second time resolution and 1.28~MHz frequency resolution for 10.5 hours of observations, over 400 square degrees of the sky. We de-dispersed the dynamic spectrum in each of 372,100 resolution elements of 2$\times$2 arcmin$^{2}$, between dispersion measures of 170 and 675~pc~cm$^{-3}$. Based on the event rate calculations in Trott, Tingay & Wayth (2013), which assumes a standard candle luminosity of $8\times10^{37}$ Js$^{-1}$, we predict that with this choice of observational parameters, the MWA should detect ($\sim10$,$\sim2$,$\sim0$) FRBs with spectral indices corresponding to ($-$2, $-$1, 0), based on a 7$\sigma$ detection threshold. We find no FRB candidates above this threshold from our search, placing an event rate limit of $<700$ above 700 Jy.ms per day per sky and providing evidence against spectral indices $\alpha<-1.2$ ($S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). We compare our event rate and spectral index limits with others from the literature. We briefly discuss these limits in light of recent suggestions that supergiant pulses from young neutron stars could explain FRBs.

Even without tidal disruption, electromagnetic luminosity is generated from the battery phase of the binary when the BH interacts with the NS magnetic field. Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays or gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted in the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of fast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence rates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the transients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a precursor. The rapid ramp-up in luminosity manifests as a precursor to the burst which is $20\%-80\%$ as luminous, given 0.5~ms timing resolution. The main burst is from the peak luminosity before merger. The post-merger burst follows from the NS magnetic field migration to the BH, causing a shock. NS--BH pairs are especially desirable for ground-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories since the pair might not otherwise be detected, with electromagnetic counterparts greatly augmenting the scientific leverage beyond the GW signal. Valuably, the electromagnetic signal can break degeneracies in the parameters encoded in the GW as well as probe the NS magnetic field strength, yielding insights into open problems in NS magnetic field decay.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1510.08318,Nithyanandan Thyagarajan et al.,A Generic and Efficient E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator for Next-Generation Radio Telescopes,"Modern radio telescopes are favouring densely packed array layouts with large numbers of antennas ($N_\textrm{A}\gtrsim 1000$). Since the complexity of traditional correlators scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_\textrm{A}^2)$, there will be a steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful instruments. Through our generic and efficient E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized direct imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF) imager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to $\mathcal{O}(N_\textrm{A}\log_2 N_\textrm{A})$ but can also image from irregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular, parallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available. We have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional techniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also validated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1). We provide a detailed framework for imaging with heterogeneous arrays and show that EPIC robustly estimates the input sky model for such arrays. Antenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting of a large number of antennas such as LWA, the Square Kilometre Array, Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment will gain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of EPIC. The algorithm is a strong candidate for instruments targeting transient searches of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) as well as planetary and exoplanetary phenomena due to the availability of high-speed calibrated time-domain images and low output bandwidth relative to visibility-based systems.",astro-ph.IM

Survey description and initial discoveries,"We are conducting a survey for pulsars and transients using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The GMRT High Resolution Southern Sky (GHRSS) survey is an off-Galactic-plane (|b|>5) survey in the declination range -40 deg to -54 deg at 322 MHz. With the high time (up to 30.72 micro-sec) and frequency (up to 0.016275 MHz) resolution observing modes, the 5-sigma detection limit is 0.5 mJy for a 2 ms pulsar with 10% duty cycle at 322 MHz. Total GHRSS sky coverage of 2866 square-deg, will result from 1953 pointing, each covering 1.8 square-deg. The 10-sigma detection limit for a 5 milli-sec transient burst is 1.6 Jy for the GHRSS survey. In addition, the GHRSS survey can reveal transient events like rotating radio transients or fast radio bursts. With 35% of the survey completed (i.e. 1000 square-deg), we report the discovery of 10 pulsars, one of which is a millisecond pulsar (MSP), one of the highest pulsar per square degree discovery rates for any off-Galactic plane survey. We re-detected 23 known in-beam pulsars. Utilising the imaging capability of the GMRT we also localised 4 of the GHRSS pulsars (including the MSP) in the gated image plane within +/- 10 arc-second. We demonstrated rapid convergence in pulsar timing with a more precise position than is possible with single dish discoveries. We also exhibited that we can localise the brightest transient sources with simultaneously obtained lower time resolution imaging data, demonstrating a technique that may have application in the SKA.",astro-ph.SR

Chu et al.,Capturing the electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers through low latency gravitational wave triggers,"We investigate the prospects for joint low-latency gravitational wave (GW) detection and prompt electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs). For BNS mergers associated with short duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), we for the first time evaluate the feasibility of rapid EM follow-ups to capture the prompt emission, early engine activity or reveal any potential by-products such as magnetars or fast radio bursts. To achieve our goal, we first simulate a population of coalescing BNSs using realistic distributions of source parameters and estimate the detectability and localisation efficiency at different times before merger. We then use a selection of facilities with GW follow-up agreements in place, from low-frequency radio to high energy $\gamma$-ray to assess the prospects of prompt follow-up. We quantify our assessment using observational SGRB flux data extrapolated to be within the horizon distances of the advanced GW interferometric detectors LIGO and Virgo and to the prompt phase immediately following the binary merger. Our results illustrate that while challenging, breakthrough multi-messenger science is possible with EM follow-up facilities with fast responses and wide fields-of-view. We demonstrate that the opportunity to catch the prompt stage ($<$ 5s) of SGRBs, can be enhanced by speeding up the detection pipelines of both GW observatories and EM follow-up facilities. We further show that the addition of an Australian instrument to the optimal detector network could possibly improve the angular resolution by a factor of two and thereby contribute significantly to GW-EM multi-messenger astronomy.",astro-ph.HE

SchÃ¼ssler et al.,The H.E.S.S. multi-messenger program,"Based on fundamental particle physics processes like the production and subsequent decay of pions in interactions of high-energy particles, close connections exist between the acceleration sites of high-energy cosmic rays and the emission of high-energy gamma rays and high-energy neutrinos. In most cases these connections provide both spatial and temporal correlations of the different emitted particles. The combination of the complementary information provided by these messengers allows to lift ambiguities in the interpretation of the data and enables novel and highly sensitive analyses. In this contribution the H.E.S.S. multi-messenger program is introduced and described. The current core of this newly installed program is the combination of high-energy neutrinos and high-energy gamma rays. The search for gamma-ray emission following gravitational wave triggers is also discussed. Furthermore, the existing program for following triggers in the electromagnetic regime was extended by the search for gamma-ray emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).

One type of source which has not been considered in the radio background is that of fast transients (those with event times much less than the observing time). We present a simple estimate, and a more detailed calculation, for the contribution of radio transients to the diffuse background. As a timely example, we estimate the contribution from the recently-discovered fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although their contribution is likely 6 or 7 orders of magnitude too small (though there are large uncertainties in FRB parameters) to account for the ARCADE~2 excess, our development is general and so can be applied to any fast transient sources, discovered or yet to be discovered. We estimate parameter values necessary for transient sources to noticeably contribute to the radio background.",astro-ph.CO

Petroff et al.,A survey of FRB fields: Limits on repeatability,"Several theories exist to explain the source of the bright, millisecond duration pulses known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). If the progenitors of FRBs are non-cataclysmic, such as giant pulses from pulsars, pulsar-planet binaries, or magnetar flares, FRB emission may be seen to repeat. We have undertaken a survey of the fields of eight known FRBs from the High Time Resolution Universe survey to search for repeating pulses. Although no repeat pulses were detected the survey yielded the detection of a new FRB, described in Petroff et al. (2015a). From our observations we rule out periodic repeating sources with periods P $\leq$ 8.6 hours and rule out sources with periods 8.6 < P < 21 hours at the 90% confidence level. At P $\geq$ 21 hours our limits fall off as ~1/P. Dedicated and persistent observations of FRB source fields are needed to rule out repetition on longer timescales, a task well-suited to next generation wide-field transient detectors.",astro-ph.HE

Proposed explanations cover a broad range from exotic processes at cosmological distances to atmospheric and terrestrial sources. Loeb et al. have previously suggested that FRB sources could be nearby flare stars, and pointed out the presence of a W-UMa-type contact binary within the beam of one out of three FRB fields that they examined. Using time-domain optical photometry and spectroscopy, we now find possible flare stars in additional FRB fields, with one to three such cases among eight FRB fields studied. We evaluate the chance probabilities of these possible associations to be in the range 0.1% to 9%, depending on the input assumptions. Further, we re-analyze the probability that two FRBs recently discovered 3 years apart within the same radio beam are unrelated. Contrary to other claims, we conclude with 99% confidence that the two events are from the same repeating source. The different dispersion measures between the two bursts then rule out a cosmological origin for the dispersion measure, but are consistent with the flare-star scenario with a varying plasma blanket between bursts. Finally, we review some theoretical objections that have been raised against a local flare-star FRB origin, and show that they are incorrect.",astro-ph.SR

Karastergiou et al.,"Limits on Fast Radio Bursts at 145 MHz with ARTEMIS, a real-time software backend","Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are millisecond radio signals that exhibit dispersion larger than what the Galactic electron density can account for. We have conducted a 1446 hour survey for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at 145~MHz, covering a total of 4193 sq. deg on the sky. We used the UK station of the LOFAR radio telescope -- the Rawlings Array -- , accompanied for a majority of the time by the LOFAR station at Nan\c{c}ay, observing the same fields at the same frequency. Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics processing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320 cm$^{-3}$ pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ for 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy. The non-detection could be due to scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if their spectra follow a power law with frequency ($\propto \nu^{\alpha}$), with $\alpha\gtrsim+0.1$, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our results suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect, estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1506.01704,"Kiyoshi Wesley Masui, Kris Sigurdson, ",Dispersion Distance and the Matter Distribution of the Universe in Dispersion Space,"We propose that ""standard pings"", brief broadband radio impulses, can be used to study the three-dimensional clustering of matter in the Universe even in the absence of redshift information. The dispersion of radio waves as they travel through the intervening plasma can, like redshift, be used as a cosmological distance measure. Because of inhomogeneities in the electron density along the line of sight, dispersion is an imperfect proxy for radial distance and we show that this leads to calculable dispersion-space distortions in the apparent clustering of sources. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a new class of radio transients that are the prototypical standard ping and, due to their high observed dispersion, have been interpreted as originating at cosmological distances. The rate of fast radio bursts has been estimated to be several thousand over the whole sky per day and, if cosmological, the sources of these events should trace the large-scale structure of the Universe. We calculate the dispersion-space power spectra for a simple model where electrons and FRBs are biased tracers of the large-scale structure of the Universe and we show that the clustering signal could be measured using as few as 10 000 events. Such a survey is in line with what may be achieved with upcoming wide-field radio telescopes.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1505.08147,Zachary Shand et al.,Quark Nova Model for Fast Radio Bursts,"FRBs are puzzling, millisecond, energetic radio transients with no discernible source; observations show no counterparts in other frequency bands. The birth of a quark star from a parent neutron star experiencing a quark nova - previously thought undetectable when born in isolation - provides a natural explanation for the emission characteristics of FRBs. The generation of unstable r-process elements in the quark nova ejecta provides millisecond exponential injection of electrons into the surrounding strong magnetic field at the parent neutron star's light cylinder via $\beta$-decay. This radio synchrotron emission has a total duration of hundreds of milliseconds and matches the observed spectrum while reducing the inferred dispersion measure by approximately 200 cm$^{-3}$ pc. The model allows indirect measurement of neutron star magnetic fields and periods in addition to providing astronomical measurements of $\beta$-decay chains of unstable neutron rich nuclei. Using this model, we can calculate expected FRB average energies ($\sim$ 10$^{41}$ ergs), spectra shapes and provide a theoretical framework for determining distances.",astro-ph.HE

arXiv:1505.06220,"J. I. Katz, ","Inferences from the Distributions of Fast Radio Burst Pulse Widths, Dispersion Measures and Fluences","The widths, dispersion measures, dispersion indices and fluences of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) impose coupled constraints that all models must satisfy. Observation of dispersion indices close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound on the size of any dispersive plasma cloud. The non-monotonic dependence of burst widths (after deconvolution of instrumental effects) on dispersion measure excludes the intergalactic medium as the location of scattering that broadens the FRB in time. Temporal broadening far greater than that of pulsars at similar high Galactic latitudes implies that scattering occurs close to the sources, where high densities and strong turbulence are plausible. FRB energetics are consistent with supergiant pulses from young, fast, high-field pulsars at cosmological distances. The distribution of FRB dispersion measures is inconsistent with expanding clouds (such as SNR). It excludes space-limited distributions (such as the local supercluster), but agrees with a homogeneous cosmological distribution with intergalactic dispersion. The FRB $\log{N}$--$\log{S}$ relation also indicates a cosmological distribution, aside from the anomalously bright Lorimer burst.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1505.05893,"Jean-Pierre Macquart, Simon Johnston, ",On the paucity of Fast Radio Bursts at low Galactic latitudes,"We examine the effect of Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation as a means of explaining the reported deficit of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) detections at low Galactic latitude. We model the unknown underlying FRB flux density distribution as a power law with a rate scaling as $S_\nu^{-5/2+\delta}$ and account for the fact that the FRBs are detected at unknown positions within the telescope beam. We find that the event rate of FRBs located off the Galactic plane may be enhanced by a factor ~30-300% relative to objects near the Galactic plane without necessarily affecting the slope of the distribution. For FRBs whose flux densities are subject to relatively weak diffractive scintillation, as is typical for events detected at high Galactic latitudes, we demonstrate that an effect associated with Eddington bias is responsible for the enhancement. The magnitude of the enhancement increases with the steepness of the underlying flux density distribution, so that existing limits on the disparity in event rates between high and low Galactic latitudes suggest that the FRB population has a steep differential flux density distribution, scaling as $S_\nu^{-3.5}$ or steeper. Existing estimates of the event rate in the flux density range probed by the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey overestimate the true rate by a factor of ~3.",astro-ph.HE

Within a few hundred years of a core-collapse supernova the ejecta is confined within $\sim$1 pc, providing a high enough column density of free electrons for the observed 375-1600 pc cm$^{-3}$ of dispersion measure (DM). By extrapolating a Crab-like pulsar to its infancy in an environment like that of SN 1987A, we hypothesize such an object could emit supergiant pulses sporadically which would be bright enough to be seen at a few hundred megaparsecs. We hypothesize that such supergiant pulses would preferentially occur early in the pulsar's life when the free electron density is still high, which is why we do not see large numbers of moderate DM FRBs ($\lesssim300$ pc cm$^{-3}$). In this scenario Faraday rotation at the source gives rotation measures (RMs) much larger than the expected cosmological contribution. If the emission were pulsar-like, then the polarization vector could swing over the duration of the burst, which is not expected from non-rotating objects. In this model, the scattering, large DM, and commensurate RM all come from one place which is not the case for the cosmological interpretation. The model also provides testable predictions of the flux distribution and repeat rate of FRBs, and could be further verified by spatial coincidence with optical supernovae of the past several decades and cross-correlation with nearby galaxy maps.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1505.01052,"Rob Fender, Tom Oosterloo, ",Neutral hydrogen absorption towards Fast Radio Bursts,"If Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly at astronomical, in particular cosmological, distances, they represent one of the most exciting discoveries in astrophysics of the past decade. However, the distance to FRBs has, to date, been estimated purely from their excess dispersion, and has not been corroborated by any independent means. In this paper we discuss the possibility of detecting neutral hydrogen absorption against FRBs both from spiral arms within our own galaxy, or from intervening extragalactic HI clouds. In either case a firm lower limit on the distance to the FRB would be established. Absorption against galactic spiral arms may already be detectable for bright low-latitude bursts with existing facilities, and should certainly be so by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Absorption against extragalactic HI clouds, which would confirm the cosmological distances of FRBs, should also be detectable with the SKA, and maybe also Arecibo. Quantitatively, we estimate that SKA1-MID should be able to detect extragalactic HI absorption against a few percent of FRBs at a redshift z~1.",astro-ph.HE

We re-detected 20 of the 42 pulsars reported by Burgay et al. and one rotating radio transient reported by Burke-Spolaor. No FRBs were discovered in this survey. Taking into account this result, and other recent surveys at Parkes, we corrected for detection sensitivities based on the search software used in the analyses and the different backends used in these surveys and find that the all-sky FRB event rate for sources with a fluence above 4.0 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz to be ${\cal R} = 4.4^{+5.2}_{-3.1} \times 10^3$ FRBs day$^{-1}$ sky$^{-1}$, where the uncertainties represent a $99\%$ confidence interval.

Mock Spectrometer Data Analysis, Survey Sensitivity, and the Discovery of 41 Pulsars","The on-going PALFA survey at the Arecibo Observatory began in 2004 and is searching for radio pulsars in the Galactic plane at 1.4 GHz. Observations since 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than were previously employed in this survey. A new data reduction pipeline has been in place since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion, searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as well as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection heuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8 millisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery totals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The pipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars including 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously searched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey sensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been determined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and amplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered with the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey achieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we also find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used there is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that gradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc. This degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. We find that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be detected in the absence of red noise. This reduced sensitivity could have implications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the Galaxy.",astro-ph.HE

In fact, their similarity to FRB 010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of ""fast radio bursts,"" which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. Until now, the physical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. We have identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 GHz associated with several peryton events. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle. Radio emission escaping from microwave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of the observed properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has been identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site could not have caused FRB 010724.

We simulate the spatial distribution of fast radio bursts and calculate the dispersion measures along the sightlines from fast radio bursts to the edge of host galaxies by using the scaled NE2001 model for thermal electron density distributions. We find that contributions to the dispersion measure of fast radio bursts from the host galaxy follow a skew Gaussian distribution. The peak and the width at half maximum of the dispersion measure distribution increase with the inclination angle of a spiral galaxy, to large values when the inclination angle is over $70\degr$. The largest dispersion measure produced by an edge-on spiral galaxy can reach a few thousand pc~cm$^{-3}$, while the dispersion measures from dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies have a maximum of only a few tens of pc~cm$^{-3}$. Notice, however, that additional dispersion measures of tens to hundreds of pc~cm$^{-3}$ can be produced by high density clumps in host galaxies.

RRATs are pulsars with sporadic emission that are detected through their bright single pulses rather than Fourier domain searches. We have developed {\tt RRATtrap}, a single-pulse sifting algorithm that can be integrated into pulsar survey data analysis pipelines in order to find RRATs and Fast Radio Bursts. We have conducted follow-up observations of our newly discovered sources at several radio frequencies using the GBT and Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), yielding improved positions and measurements of their periods, dispersion measures, and burst rates, as well as phase-coherent timing solutions for four of them. The new RRATs have dispersion measures (DMs) ranging from 15 to 97 pc cm$^{-3}$, periods of 240 ms to 3.4 s, and estimated burst rates of 20 to 400 pulses hr$^{-1}$ at 350 MHz. We use this new sample of RRATs to perform statistical comparisons between RRATs and canonical pulsars in order to shed light on the relationship between the two populations. We find that the DM and spatial distributions of the RRATs agree with those of the pulsars found in the same survey. We find evidence that slower pulsars (i.e. $P>200$ ms) are preferentially more likely to emit bright single pulses than are faster pulsars ($P<200$ ms), although this conclusion is tentative. Our results are consistent with the proposed link between RRATs, transient pulsars, and canonical pulsars as sources in various parts of the pulse activity spectrum.",astro-ph.HE

Garrett, ","SETI reloaded, Next Generation Radio Telescopes, Transients and Cognitive Computing","The Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) using radio telescopes is an area of research that is now more than 50 years old. Thus far, both targeted and wide-area surveys have yet to detect artificial signals from intelligent civilisations. In this paper, I argue that the incidence of co-existing intelligent and communicating civilisations is probably small in the Milky Way. While this makes successful SETI searches a very difficult pursuit indeed, the huge impact of even a single detection requires us to continue the search. A substantial increase in the overall performance of radio telescopes (and in particular future wide-field instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array, SKA), provide renewed optimism in the field. Evidence for this is already to be seen in the success of SETI researchers in acquiring observations on some of the world's most sensitive radio telescope facilities via open, peer-reviewed processes. The increasing interest in the dynamic radio sky, and our ability to detect new and rapid transient phenomena such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) is also greatly encouraging. While the nature of FRBs is not yet fully understood, I argue they are unlikely to be the signature of distant extra-terrestrial civilisations. As astronomers face a data avalanche on all sides, advances made in related areas such as advanced Big Data analytics, and cognitive computing are crucial to enable serendipitous discoveries to be made.

The observed large dispersion measure values of FRBs suggests an extragalactic origin and an accurate determination of their positions and distances will provide an unique opportunity to study the magneto-ionic properties of the IGM. So far, FRBs have all been found using large dishes equipped with multi-pixel arrays. While large single dishes are well-suited for the discovery of transient sources they are poor at providing accurate localisations. A 2D snapshot image of the sky, made with a correlation interferometer array, can provide an accurate localisation of many compact radio sources simultaneously. However, the required time resolution to detect FRBs and a desire to detect them in real time, makes this currently impractical. In a beamforming approach, where many narrow tied-array beams are produced, the advantages of single dishes and interferometers can be combined. We present a proof-of-concept analysis of a new non-imaging method that utilises the additional spectral and comparative spatial information obtained from multiple overlapping TABs to estimate a transient source location with up to arcsecond accuracy in almost real time. We show that this method can work for a variety of interferometric configurations, including for LOFAR and MeerKAT, and that the estimated angular position may be sufficient to identify a host galaxy without reference to other simultaneous or follow-up observations. With this method, many transient sources can be localised to small fractions of a HPBW of a TAB, in the case of MeerKAT, sufficient to localise a source to arcsecond accuracy. In cases where the position is less accurately determined we can still significantly reduce the area that need be searched for associated emission at other wavelengths and potential host galaxies.",astro-ph.IM
arXiv:1502.05171,"J. J. Geng, Y. F. Huang, ",Fast Radio Bursts: Collisions between Neutron Stars and Asteroids/Comets,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are newly discovered radio transient sources. Their high dispersion measures indicate an extragalactic origin. But due to the lack of observational data in other wavelengths, their progenitors still remain unclear. Here we suggest the collisions between neutron stars and asteroids/comets as a promising mechanism for FRBs. During the impact process, a hot plasma fireball will form after the material of the small body penetrates into the neutron star surface. The ionized matter inside the fireball will then expand along the magnetic field lines. Coherent radiation from the thin shell at the top of the fireball will account for the observed FRBs. Our scenario can reasonably explain the main features of FRBs, such as their durations, luminosities, and the event rate. We argue that for a single neutron star, FRBs are not likely to happen repeatedly in a forseeable time span since such impacts are of low probability. We predict that faint remnant X-ray emissions should be associated with FRBs, but it may be too faint to be detected by detectors at work.",astro-ph.HE

Macquart et al.,Fast Transients at Cosmological Distances with the SKA,"Impulsive radio bursts that are detectable across cosmological distances constitute extremely powerful probes of the ionized Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM), intergalactic magnetic fields, and the properties of space-time itself. Their dispersion measures (DMs) will enable us to detect the ""missing"" baryons in the low-redshift Universe and make the first measurements of the mean galaxy halo profile, a key parameter in models of galaxy formation and feedback. Impulsive bursts can be used as cosmic rulers at redshifts exceeding 2, and constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$ at redshifts beyond those readily accessible by Type Ia SNe. Both of these goals are realisable with a sample of $\sim 10^4$ fast radio bursts (FRBs) whose positions are localized to within one arcsecond, sufficient to obtain host galaxy redshifts via optical follow-up. It is also hypothesised that gravitational wave events may emit coherent emission at frequencies probed by SKA1-LOW, and the localization of such events at cosmological distances would enable their use as cosmological standard sirens.   To perform this science, such bursts must be localized to their specific host galaxies so that their redshifts may be obtained and compared against their dispersion measures, rotation measures, and scattering properties. The SKA can achieve this with a design that has a wide field-of-view, a substantial fraction of its collecting area in a compact configuration (80\% within a 3\,km radius), and a capacity to attach high-time-resolution instrumentation to its signal path.",astro-ph.HE

The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Galactic magnetic field and electron density distribution may be probed through observations of radio pulsars, primarily owing to their compact nature, high velocities, and highly-polarized short-duration radio pulses. Phase 1 of the SKA, i.e. SKA1, will increase the known pulsar population by an order of magnitude, and the full SKA, i.e. SKA2, will discover pulsars in the most distant regions of our Galaxy.

When combined, these observations will enable detailed tomography of the large-scale magneto-ionic structure of both the Galactic disk and the Galactic halo. Turbulence in the interstellar medium can be studied through the variations of these observables and the dynamic spectra of pulsar flux densities. SKA1-LOW and SKA1-MID will monitor interstellar weather and produce sensitive dynamic and secondary spectra of pulsar scintillation, which can be used to make speckle images of the ISM, study turbulence on scales between ~10^8 and ~10^13 m, and probe pulsar emission regions on scales down to $\sim$10 km.

arXiv:1412.7825,"Aiichi Iwazaki, ",Fast Radio Bursts from Axion Stars,"Axions are one of the most promising candidates of dark matter. The axions have been shown to form miniclusters with masses $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ and to become dominant component of dark matter. Some of the axion miniclusters condense to form axion stars. We have recently shown a possible origin of fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) by assuming that the axion stars are main component of halos: FRBs arise from the collisions between the axion stars and neutron stars. It is remarkable that the masses of the axion stars obtained by the comparison of the theoretical and observational event rates are coincident with the mass $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our model of FRBs in detail. We derive the approximate solutions of the axion stars with large radii and constraint their masses for the approximation to be valid. The FRBs are emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars. By calculating the optical depth of the atmospheres, we show that they are transparent for the radiations with the frequency given by the axion mass $m_a$ such as $m_a/2\pi\simeq 2.4$GHz$(m_a/10^{-5}\rm eV)$. Although the radiations are linearly polarized when they are emitted, they are shown to be circularly polarized after they pass magnetospheres of neutron stars. We also show that the FRBs are not broadband and their frequencies have finite bandwidths owing to the thermal fluctuations of the electrons in the atmospheres of the neutron stars. The presence of the finite bandwidths is a distinctive feature of our model and can be tested observationally. Furthermore, we show that similar FRBs may arise when the axion stars collide with magnetic white dwarfs $B\sim 10^9$G. The distinctive feature is that the durations of the bursts are of the order of $0.1$second.",hep-ph

Law et al.,A Millisecond Interferometric Search for Fast Radio Bursts with the Very Large Array,"We report on the first millisecond timescale radio interferometric search for the new class of transient known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). We used the Very Large Array (VLA) for a 166-hour, millisecond imaging campaign to detect and precisely localize an FRB. We observed at 1.4 GHz and produced visibilities with 5 ms time resolution over 256 MHz of bandwidth. Dedispersed images were searched for transients with dispersion measures from 0 to 3000 pc/cm3. No transients were detected in observations of high Galactic latitude fields taken from September 2013 though October 2014. Observations of a known pulsar show that images typically had a thermal-noise limited sensitivity of 120 mJy/beam (8 sigma; Stokes I) in 5 ms and could detect and localize transients over a wide field of view. Our nondetection limits the FRB rate to less than 7e4/sky/day (95% confidence) above a fluence limit of 1.2 Jy-ms. Assuming a Euclidean flux distribution, the VLA rate limit is inconsistent with the published rate of Thornton et al. We recalculate previously published rates with a homogeneous consideration of the effects of primary beam attenuation, dispersion, pulse width, and sky brightness. This revises the FRB rate downward and shows that the VLA observations had a roughly 60% chance of detecting a typical FRB and that a 95% confidence constraint would require roughly 500 hours of similar VLA observing. Our survey also limits the repetition rate of an FRB to 2 times less than any known repeating millisecond radio transient.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1412.6119,"Jim Fuller, Christian Ott, ",Dark Matter-induced Collapse of Neutron Stars: A Possible Link Between Fast Radio Bursts and the Missing Pulsar Problem,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an emerging class of short and bright radio transients whose sources remain enigmatic. Within the galactic center, the non-detection of pulsars within the inner $\sim \!10\,{\rm pc}$ has created a missing pulsar problem that has intensified with time. With all reserve, we advance the notion that the two problems could be linked by a common solution: the collapse of neutron stars (NS) due to capture and sedimentation of dark matter (DM) within their cores. Bramante \& Linden (2014), Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.~19, 191301 showed that certain DM properties allow for rapid NS collapse within the high DM density environments near galactic centers while permitting NS survival elsewhere. Each DM-induced collapse could generate an FRB as the NS magnetosphere is suddenly expelled. This scenario could explain several features of FRBs: their short time scales, large energies, locally produced scattering tails, and high event rates. We predict that FRBs are localized to galactic centers, and that our own galactic center harbors a large population of NS-mass ($M\sim1.4 M_\odot$) black holes. The DM-induced collapse scenario is intrinsically unlikely because it can only occur in a small region of allowable DM parameter space. However, if observed to occur, it would place tight constraints on DM properties.",astro-ph.HE

Dolag et al.,Constraints on the distribution and energetics of fast radio bursts using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations,"We present constraints on the origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) using large cosmological simulations. We calculate contributions to FRB dispersion measures (DMs) from the Milky Way, from the local Universe, from cosmological large-scale structure, and from potential FRB host galaxies, and then compare these simulations to the DMs of observed FRBs. We find that the Milky Way contribution has previously been underestimated by a factor of ~2, and that the foreground-subtracted DMs are consistent with a cosmological origin, corresponding to a source population observable to a maximum redshift z~0.6-0.9. We consider models for the spatial distribution of FRBs in which they are randomly distributed in the Universe, track the star-formation rate of their host galaxies, track total stellar mass, or require a central supermassive black hole. Current data do not discriminate between these possibilities, but the predicted DM distributions for different models will differ considerably once we begin detecting FRBs at higher DMs and higher redshifts. We additionally consider the distribution of FRB fluences, and show that the observations are consistent with FRBs being standard candles, each burst producing the same radiated isotropic energy. The data imply a constant isotropic burst energy of ~7e40 erg if FRBs are embedded in host galaxies, or ~9e40 erg if FRBs are randomly distributed. These energies are 10-100 times larger than had previously been inferred. Within the constraints of the available small sample of data, our analysis favours FRB mechanisms for which the isotropic radiated energy has a narrow distribution in excess of 1e40 erg.",astro-ph.CO

New instrumentation has decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM) of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z \lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularly polarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linear polarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the FRB.

FRB 140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and lies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs of these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to sampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects.

Ofek, ","An accurate and efficient algorithm for detection of radio bursts with an unknown dispersion measure, for single dish telescopes and interferometers","Astronomical radio bursts disperse while traveling through the interstellar medium. To optimally detect a short-duration signal within a frequency band, we have to precisely compensate for the pulse dispersion, which is a computationally demanding task. We present the Fast Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm for optimal detection of such signals. Our algorithm has a low theoretical complexity of 2N_f N_t+ N_t N_d log_2(N_f) where N_f, N_t and N_d are the numbers of frequency bins, time bins, and dispersion measure bins, respectively. Unlike previously suggested fast algorithms our algorithm conserves the sensitivity of brute force dedispersion. Our tests indicate that this algorithm, running on a standard desktop computer, and implemented in a high-level programming language, is already faster than the state of the art dedispersion codes running on graphical processing units (GPUs). We also present a variant of the algorithm that can be efficiently implemented on GPUs. The latter algorithm's computation and data transport requirements are similar to those of two-dimensional FFT, indicating that incoherent dedispersion can now be considered a non-issue while planning future surveys. We further present a fast algorithm for sensitive dedispersion of pulses shorter than normally allowed by incoherent dedispersion. In typical cases this algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than coherent dedispersion by convolution. We analyze the computational complexity of pulsed signal searches by radio interferometers. We conclude that, using our suggested algorithms, maximally sensitive blind searches for such pulses is feasible using existing facilities.

We show that if the dispersion measures resulted from propagation through the intergalactic medium at cosmological distances and the pulse widths were a consequence of scattering by single thin screens, then the screens' electron densities were $\gtrsim 20$/cm$^3$, $10^8$ times the mean intergalactic density. This problem is resolved if the radiation scattered close to its source, where high densities are possible. Observation of dispersion indices close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound on the size of the dispersive plasma cloud, excluding terrestrial or Solar System origin. The scattering and much of the dispersion measures may be attributed to scattering regions about 1 AU from the sources, with electron densities $\sim 3 \times 10^8$/cm$^3$. The inferred parameters are only marginally consistent; re-examination of the assumed relation between dispersion measure and distance is warranted. Origin in an ionized starburst or protogalaxy is suggested, but statistical arguments exclude compact young SNR in the Galactic neighborhood.

Such agreements between the FRBs and SCS bursts suggest that the FRBs could originate from SCS bursts and thus they could provide an effective probe to study SCSs.

We propose here a new explanation - not requiring an extreme release of energy - involving a body (planet, asteroid, white dwarf) orbiting an extragalactic pulsar. We investigate a theory of radio waves associated to such pulsar-orbiting bodies. We focus our analysis on the waves emitted from the magnetic wake of the body in the pulsar wind. After deriving their properties, we compare them with the observations of various transient radio signals in order to see if they could originate from pulsar-orbiting bodies. The analysis is based on the theory of Alfv\'en wings: for a body immersed in a pulsar wind, a system of two stationary Alfv\'en waves is attached to the body, provided that the wind is highly magnetized. When destabilized through plasma instabilities, Alfv\'en wings can be the locus of strong radio sources convected with the pulsar wind. Assuming a cyclotron maser instability operating in the Alfv\'en wings, we make predictions about the shape, frequencies and brightness of the resulting radio emissions. Because of the beaming by relativistic aberration, the signal is seen only when the companion is perfectly aligned between its parent pulsar and the observer, as for occultations. For pulsar winds with a high Lorentz factor, the whole duration of the radio event does not exceed a few seconds, and it is composed of one to four peaks lasting a few milliseconds each, detectable up to distances of several Mpc. The Lorimer burst, the three isolated pulses of PSR J1928+15, and the recently detected fast radio bursts are all compatible with our model. According to it, these transient signals should repeat periodically with the companion's orbital period. The search of pulsar-orbiting bodies could be an exploration theme for new- or next-generation radio telescopes.",astro-ph.EP

Each observation covered ~75 sq. deg using 7 independent fields formed by incoherently summing the high-band antenna fields. The second pilot survey, the LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS), spanned ~600 sq. deg, with roughly a 5-fold increase in sensitivity compared with LPPS. Using a coherent sum of the 6 LOFAR ""Superterp"" stations, we formed 19 tied-array beams, together covering 4 sq. deg per pointing.

Although theoretical predictions on luminosities of kilonovae are still highly uncertain, recent models suggest that kilonovae can be detected at redshifts up to z $\sim$ 0.3 within the range of the uncertainties. We expect $\sim$ 1--5 unrelated supernovae (SNe) down to a similar variability magnitude in 5 days interval within the typical error radius of a FRB. We show that, however, a kilonova can be distinguished from these SNe by its rapid decay and/or color evolution, making it possible to verify the existence of a kilonova associated with a FRB. We also discuss the case that SNe Ia are FRB optical counterparts, as it might be if FRBs originate from double white dwarf binaries. Verification of this scenario is also possible, since the chance probability of finding a SNe Ia having consistent explosion time with that of a FRB within the FRB error region is small (typically $\lesssim$ 0.01).",astro-ph.HE

We consider that this survey, and many other archival low-latitude (|gb|<30deg) pulsar surveys, have been searched for FRBs but produced fewer detections than the comparatively brief Thornton et al.~search. Such a rate dependence on Galactic position could provide critical supporting evidence for an extragalactic origin for FRBs. To test this, we form an analytic expression to account for Galactic position and survey setup in FRB rate predictions. Employing a sky temperature, scattering, and dispersion model of the Milky Way, we compute the expected number of FRBs if they are isotropically distributed on the sky w.r.t. Galactic position (i.e. local), and if they are of extragalactic origin. We demonstrate that the relative detection rates reject a local origin with a confidence of 99.96% (~3.6 sigma). The extragalactic predictions provide a better agreement, however are still strong discrepancies with the low-latitude detection rate at a confidence of 99.69% (~2.9 sigma).

Assuming that at least some of them are of a cosmological origin, we calculate their afterglow lightcurves in multi-wavelengths (X-rays, optical and radio) by assuming a range of their total kinetic energies and redshifts. We focus on forward shock emission, but also consider the possibility that some of them might have bright reverse shock emission. In general, the FRB afterglows are too faint to be detected by current detectors. Only if an FRB has a very low radiative efficiency in radio (hence, a very large kinetic energy), and when it is close enough, can its afterglow be detected in the optical and radio bands. We discuss observational strategies to detect these faint afterglows using future telescopes such as LSST and EVLA.",astro-ph.HE

With the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument, we record 100 MHz of bandwidth divided into 4,096 channels every 81.92 $\mu s$. This survey will cover the entire sky visible to the Green Bank Telescope ($\delta > -40^\circ$, or 82% of the sky) and outside of the Galactic Plane will be sensitive enough to detect slow pulsars and low dispersion measure ($<$30 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$) millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with a 0.08 duty cycle down to 1.1 mJy. For pulsars with a spectral index of $-$1.6, we will be 2.5 times more sensitive than previous and ongoing surveys over much of our survey region. Here we describe the survey, the data analysis pipeline, initial discovery parameters for 62 pulsars, and timing solutions for 5 new pulsars. PSR J0214$+$5222 is an MSP in a long-period (512 days) orbit and has an optical counterpart identified in archival data. PSR J0636$+$5129 is an MSP in a very short-period (96 minutes) orbit with a very low mass companion (8 $M_\mathrm{J}$). PSR J0645$+$5158 is an isolated MSP with a timing residual RMS of 500 ns and has been added to pulsar timing array experiments. PSR J1434$+$7257 is an isolated, intermediate-period pulsar that has been partially recycled.

arXiv:1406.3520,"Yun-Wei Yu, ",Revisiting the dispersion measure of fast radio bursts associated with gamma-ray burst afterglows,"Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) are expected to be associated with the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while a short-lived, supermassive neutron star (NS) forms during the GRBs. I investigate the possible contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) of the FRBs from the GRB ejecta and the wind blown from the precollapsing NS. On the one hand, sometimes an internal X-ray plateau afterglow could be produced by the NS wind, which indicates that a great number of electron-positron pairs are carried by the wind. If the pair-generation radius satisfies a somewhat rigorous condition, the relativistic and dense wind would contribute a high DM to the associated FRB, which can be comparable to and even exceed the DM contributed by the intergalactic medium. On the other hand, if the wind only carries a Goldreich-Julian particle flux, its DM contribution would become negligible; meanwhile, the internal plateau afterglow would not appear. Alternatively, the FRB should be associated with a GRB afterglow produced by the GRB external shock, i.e., an energy-injection-caused shallow-decay afterglow or a normal single-power-law afterglow if the impulsive energy release of the GRB is high enough. In the latter case, the DM contributed by the high-mass GRB ejecta could be substantially important, in particular, for an environment of main-sequence stellar wind. In summary, a careful assessment on the various DM contributors could be required for the cosmological application of the expected FRB-GRB association. The future DM measurements of GRB-associated FRBs could provide a constraint on the physics of NS winds.",astro-ph.SR
arXiv:1406.1850,Divya Palaniswamy et al.,A Search for Fast Radio Bursts Associated with Gamma-Ray Bursts,"The detection of six Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has recently been reported. FRBs are short duration ($\sim$ 1 ms), highly dispersed radio pulses from astronomical sources. The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and slew to the GRB position within $\sim$ 140 s. The data were searched for pulses up to 5000 pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from 640 $\rm \mu$s to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events $\rm \geq 6 \sigma$. An in-depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above $\rm 5 \sigma$ are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only. A joint analysis of our data with previous experiments shows that previously claimed detections of FRBs from GRBs are unlikely to be astrophysical. Our results are in line with the lack of consistency noted between the recently presented FRB event rates and GRB event rates.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1405.5945,E. Petroff et al.,An absence of fast radio bursts at intermediate galactic latitudes,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an emerging class of bright, highly dispersed radio pulses. Recent work by Thornton et al. (2013) has revealed a population of FRBs in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at high Galactic latitudes. A variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmic events at cosmological distances, Galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radio frequency interference. Here we report on a search for FRBs at intermediate Galactic latitudes ($-15^{\circ}$ $< b <$ 15$^{\circ}$) in data taken as part of the HTRU survey. No FRBs were discovered in this region. Several effects such as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease the sensitivity by more than 3$\sigma$ in $\sim$20\% of survey pointings. Including all of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that FRBs are uniformly distributed on the sky with 99\% confidence. This low probability implies that additional factors -- not accounted for by standard Galactic models -- must be included to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and low Galactic latitudes. A revised rate estimate or another strong and heretofore unknown selection effect in Galactic latitude would provide closer agreement between the surveys' detection rates. The dearth of detections at low Galactic latitude disfavors a Galactic origin for these bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Spitler et al.,Fast Radio Burst Discovered in the Arecibo Pulsar ALFA Survey,"Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated, millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB 121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes. FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-GHz Pulsar ALFA survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pc cm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellar scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite its low Galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times the maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting an extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum; we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Because of the angular resolution restriction in radio surveys, no optical counter part has been identified yet so it is hard to determine the progenitor of FRBs. In this paper we propose to use radio lensing survey to constrain FRB progenitors. We show that, different types of progenitors lead to different probabilities for a FRB to be gravitationally lensed by dark matter halos in foreground galaxies, since different type progenitors result in different redshift distributions of FRBs. For example, the redshift distribution of FRBs arising from double stars shifts toward lower redshift than of the FRBs arising from single stars, because double stars and single stars have different evolution timescales. With detailed calculations, we predict that the FRB sample size for producing one lensing event varies significantly for different FRB progenitor models. We argue that this fact can be used to distinguish different FRB models and also discuss the practical possibility of using lensing observation in radio surveys to constrain FRB progenitors.",astro-ph.HE

Sharp cut-offs in X-ray afterglow plateaus of some SGRBs hint at the gravitational collapse of these remnant NSs to black holes. The collapse of such `supramassive' NSs also describes the blitzar model, a leading candidate for the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observation of an FRB associated with an SGRB would provide compelling evidence for the blitzar model and the binary NS merger scenario of SGRBs, and lead to interesting constraints on the NS equation of state. We predict the collapse times of supramassive NSs created in binary NS mergers, finding that such stars collapse $\sim10\,{\rm s}$ -- $4.4\times10^{4}\,{\rm s}$ (95% confidence) after the merger. This directly impacts observations targeting NS remnants of binary NS mergers, providing the optimal window for high time resolution radio and X-ray follow-up of SGRBs and gravitational wave bursts.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1403.2263,"Brian Dennison, ",Fast Radio Bursts: Constraints on the Dispersing Medium,"Fast radio bursts appear to exhibit large dispersion measures, typically exceeding any expected galactic interstellar contribution, especially along the moderate to high-galactic-latitude directions in which such events have been most often observed. The dispersions have been therefore interpreted as extragalactic, leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at Gpc distances. This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic events, originating from quite small volumes (due to the millisecond burst durations). To circumvent the energetic difficulties, Loeb, Shvartzvald, & Maoz (2014) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M stars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy. Most of the dispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae. With the dispersion concentrated in a relatively high density region, the quadratic dispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable to (although less than) the propagation frequency. The observed dispersion curves are closely quadratic, however, consistent with a low density medium, ruling out this model. Because any model invoking local galactic sources would require a concentrated high density dispersing medium, it appears highly likely that the dispersions occur in the intergalactic medium. This medium, probably containing most of the baryon content of the universe, is expected to be highly structured on large scales. Hot gas within clusters and especially groups of galaxies may contribute significantly to the observed dispersion. Optical and X-ray observations, including redshifts and combined with cosmological dispersion measures, can probe the distribution of the IGM and determine how much of it lies outside the X-ray luminous concentrations seen in clusters and groups.",astro-ph.HE

The problem is then turned around and higher-order dispersion terms are connected to the moments of the density distribution along the line of sight. The deviations quantified in three observed bursts are analysed and a lower limit on the maximum electron density is obtained in one case, although with considerable uncertainty. Selection effects are then discussed and shown to be non-restrictive in relation to plasma density, except at the lowest frequencies and highest temperatures.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1402.4766,S. R. Kulkarni et al.,Giant Sparks at Cosmological Distances?,"Millisecond duration bright radio pulses at 1.4-GHz with high dispersion measures (DM) were reported by Lorimer et al., Keane et al., and Thornton et al. Their all-sky rate is $\approx 10^4$/day above $\sim$1 Jy. Related events are ""Perytons"" -- similar pulsed, dispersed sources, but most certainly local. Suggested models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can originate in the Earth's atmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies, and even at cosmological distances. Using physically motivated assumptions combined with observed properties, we explore these models. In our analysis, we focus on the Lorimer event: a 30 Jy, 5-ms duration burst with DM$=$ 375 cm$^{-3}$ pc, exhibiting a steep frequency-dependent pulse width (the {\it Sparker}). To be complete, we drop the assumption that high DMs are produced by plasma propagation and assume that the source produces pulses with frequency-dependent arrival time (""chirped signals""). Within this framework we explore a scenario in which Perytons, the {\it Sparker}, and the FRBs are all atmospheric phenomenon occurring at different heights. This model is {\it ad hoc} in that we cannot explain why Perytons at higher altitudes show greater DMs or exhibit narrower pulses. Nonetheless, we argue the {\it Sparker} may be a Peryton. We end with two remarks. First, the detection of a single FRB by an interferometer with a kilometer (or longer) baseline will prove that FRBs are of extra-terrestrial origin. Second, we urge astronomers to pursue observations and understanding of Perytons since they form (at least) a formidable foreground for the FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

If such FRB/GRB association systems are commonly detected in the future, the combination of dispersion measure (DM) derived from FRBs and redshifts derived from GRBs makes these systems a plausible tool to conduct cosmography. We quantify uncertainties in deriving the redshift-dependent DM_{IGM} as a function of z, and test how well dark energy models can be constrained with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that with potentially several 10s of FRB/GRB systems detected in a decade or so, one may reach reasonable constraints on wCDM models. When combined with SN Ia data, unprecedented constraints on dark energy equation of state may be achieved, thanks to the prospects of detecting FRB/GRB systems at relatively high redshifts. The ratio between the mean value < DM_{IGM} (z)> and luminosity distance (D_{L} (z)) is insensitive to dark energy models. This gives the prospects of applying SN Ia data to calibrate < DM_{IGM} (z)> using a relatively small sample of FRB/GRB systems, allowing a reliable constraint on the baryon inhomogeneity distribution as a function of redshift. The methodology developed in this paper can also be applied, if the FRB redshifts can be measured by other means. Some caveats of putting this method into practice are also discussed.",astro-ph.CO

Here we discuss new distance constraints to the FRB010621 (a.k.a J1852$-$08) first reported by Keane. We use velocity resolved $H\alpha$ and $H\beta$ observations of diffuse ionised gas toward the burst to calculate an extinction-corrected emission measure along the line of sight. We combine this emission measure with models of Galactic rotation and of electron distribution to derive a 90% probability of the pulse residing in the Galaxy. However, we cannot differentiate between the two Galactic interpretations of Keane: a neutron star with unusual pulse amplitude distribution or Galactic black hole annihilation.",astro-ph.GA

At the onset of the magnetar flare, a strongly magnetized pulse is formed, which propagates away through the relativistic magnetar wind and eventually reaches the nebula inflated by the wind within the surrounding medium. I show that the observed radio bursts could be generated at shocks formed via the interaction of the magnetic pulse with the plasma within the nebula.

We find out that the contribution of the host galaxies to the detected dispersion measures can be inapparent for the FRBs not from galaxy centers or star forming regions. The inhomogeneity of the intergalactic medium (IGM), however, causes significant deviation of the dispersion measure from that predicted in the simplified homogeneous IGM model for individual event. Fortunately, with sufficient FRBs along different sightlines but within a very narrow redshift interval (e.g., $\Delta z \sim 0.05$ or $\Delta z \sim 0.05(1+z)$), the mean from averaging observed dispersion measures does not suffer such a problem and hence may be used as a cosmic probe. We show that in the optimistic case (e.g., tens FRBs in each $\Delta z$ have been measured; the most distant FRBs were at redshift $\geq 3$; the host galaxies and the FRB sources contribute little to the detected dispersion measures) and with all the uncertainties (i.e. the inhomogeneity of the IGM, the contribution and uncertainty of host galaxies as well as the evolution and error of $f_{\rm IGM}$) considered, FRBs could help constrain the equation of state of dark energy.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1401.1795,"Jing Luan, Peter Goldreich, ",Physical Constraints On Fast Radio Burst,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are isolated, $\ms$ radio pulses with dispersion measure (DM) of order $10^3\DMunit$. Galactic candidates for the DM of high latitude bursts detected at $\GHz$ frequencies are easily dismissed. DM from bursts emitted in stellar coronas are limited by free-free absorption and those from HII regions are bounded by the nondetection of associated free-free emission at radio wavelengths. Thus, if astronomical, FRBs are probably extra-galactic. FRB 110220 has a scattering tail of $\sim 5.6\pm 0.1 \ms$. If the electron density fluctuations arise from a turbulent cascade, the scattering is unlikely to be due to propagation through the diffuse intergalactic plasma. A more plausible explanation is that this burst sits in the central region of its host galaxy. Pulse durations of order $\ms$ constrain the sizes of FRB sources implying high brightness temperatures that indicates coherent emission.

If a good sample of FRB/GRB associations are discovered at higher redshifts, the free electron column density history can be mapped, which can be used to probe the reionization history of both hydrogen and helium in the universe. We apply our formulation to GRBs 101011A and 100704A that each might have an associated FRB, and constrained $\Omega_b f_{\rm IGM}$ to be consistent with the value derived from other methods.

We show that in the blitzar model and the model of merging binary neutron stars, the huge energy release of each FRB central engine together with the rather high rate of FRBs, the accelerated EeV cosmic rays may contribute significantly to the observed ones. In other FRB models including for example the merger of double white dwarfs and the energetic magnetar radio flares, no significant EeV cosmic ray is expected. We also suggest that the mergers of double neutron stars, even if they are irrelevant to FRBs, may play a non-ignorable role in producing EeV cosmic ray protons if supramassive neutron stars were formed in a good fraction of mergers and the merger rate is $\gtrsim 10^{3}~{\rm yr^{-1}~ Gpc^{-3}}$.

The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) operates at low radio frequencies (80-300 MHz) and is expected to detect FRBs due to its large collecting area (~2500 m^2) and wide field-of-view (FOV, ~1000 square degrees at nu=200 MHz). We compute the expected number of FRB detections for the MWA assuming a source population consistent with the reported detections. Our formalism properly accounts for the frequency-dependence of the antenna primary beam, the MWA system temperature, and unknown spectral index of the source population, for three modes of FRB detection: coherent; incoherent; and fast imaging. We find that the MWA's sensitivity and large FOV combine to provide the expectation of multiple detectable events per week in all modes, potentially making it an excellent high time resolution science instrument.

Their properties suggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to understand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately, the recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio telescopes are set to begin observing in the near future. In this paper we discuss the prospects of detecting short extragalactic bursts, in both beamformed and imaging data, using these instruments. We find that often the volume of space probed by radio surveys of fast transients is limited by the dispersion measure (DM) of the source, rather than its physical distance (although the two quantities are related). This effect is larger for low-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but, their larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this. Our simulations suggest that the low-frequency component of SKA1 could find an extragalactic burst every hour.

The basic characteristics of the FRBs, such as the energetics, emission duration and event rate, can be consistently explained in this scenario. As a result, we predict that some FRBs can accompany type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) or X-ray debris disks.

The FRB rate is within the plausible range of NS-NS merger rate and its cosmological evolution, while a large fraction of NS-NS mergers must produce observable FRBs. A likely radiation mechanism is coherent radio emission like radio pulsars, by magnetic braking when magnetic fields of neutron stars are synchronized to binary rotation at the time of coalescence. Magnetic fields of the standard strength (~ 10^{12-13} G) can explain the observed FRB fluxes, if the conversion efficiency from magnetic braking energy loss to radio emission is similar to that of isolated radio pulsars. Corresponding gamma-ray emission is difficult to detect by current or past gamma-ray burst satellites. Since FRBs tell us the exact time of mergers, a correlated search would significantly improve the effective sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.",astro-ph.HE

Thornton et al.,A Population of Fast Radio Bursts at Cosmological Distances,"Searches for transient astrophysical sources often reveal unexpected classes of objects that are useful physical laboratories. In a recent survey for pulsars and fast transients we have uncovered four millisecond-duration radio transients all more than 40{\deg} from the Galactic plane. The bursts' properties indicate that they are of celestial rather than terrestrial origin. Host galaxy and intergalactic medium models suggest that they have cosmological redshifts of 0.5 to 1, and distances of up to 3 gigaparsecs. No temporally coincident x- or gamma-ray signature was identified in association with the bursts. Characterization of the source population and identification of host galaxies offers an opportunity to determine the baryonic content of the Universe.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:1307.1409,"Heino Falcke, Luciano Rezzolla, ",Fast radio bursts: the last sign of supramassive neutron stars,"Several fast radio bursts have been discovered recently, showing a bright, highly dispersed millisecond radio pulse. The pulses do not repeat and are not associated with a known pulsar or gamma-ray burst. The high dispersion suggests sources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radio luminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. We suggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive rotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking. The neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models and is supported by rapid rotation. As magnetic braking constantly reduces the spin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios for supramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures {making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic calculations. While the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an event horizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. This can turn an almost ordinary pulsar into a bright radio ""blitzar"": Accelerated electrons from the travelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphere and produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z>0.7. Only a few percent of the neutron stars needs to be supramassive in order to explain the observed rate. We suggest that fast radio bursts might trace the solitary formation of stellar mass black holes at high redshifts. These bursts could be an electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave emission and reveal a new formation and evolutionary channel for black holes that are not seen as gamma-ray bursts. Radio observations of these bursts could trace the core-collapse supernova rate throughout the universe.",astro-ph.HE

We find a statistically significant correlation ($p$-value $<0.001$, after accounting for look-elsewhere factors) between a sample of repeaters with extragalactic DM $>395$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and WISE$\times$SCOS galaxies with redshift $z>0.275$. We demonstrate that the correlation arises surprisingly because of a statistical association between FRB 20200320A (extragalactic DM $\approx550$ pc cm$^{-3}$) and a galaxy group in the same dark matter halo at redshift $z\approx0.32$. Based on our results, we suggest incorporating galaxy group and cluster catalogs into direct host association pipelines for FRBs with $\lesssim1'$ localization precision, effectively utilizing the two-point information to constrain FRB properties such as their redshift. In addition, we find marginal evidence for a negative correlation at 99.4% CL between a sample of repeating FRBs with baseband data (median extragalactic DM $=354$ pc cm$^{-3}$) and DESI-LRG galaxies with redshift $0.3\le z<0.45$, suggesting that the repeaters might be more prone than apparent nonrepeaters to propagation effects due to intervening free electrons over angular scales $\sim0\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ$}5$.",astro-ph.GA

In this toy model, the super-repeater stage has a duration of about a few years and the period when one-off events are mostly emitted corresponds to the active life of a magnetar $\sim $few$\times 10^3$~years. Intervals between strong events (observed as one-off FRBs) from the same source are $\sim10$~years, corresponding to the expected time interval between giant flares.",astro-ph.HE

In this work, we employ a Bayesian method to search for the QPOs in the hundreds of X-ray bursts from SGR J1935+2154 observed by {\it Insight}-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM from July 2014 to January 2022. Although no definitive QPO signal (significance $>3\sigma$) is detected in individual bursts or the averaged periodogram of the bursts grouped by duration, we identify several bursts exhibiting possible QPO at $\sim$ 40 Hz, which is consistent with that reported in the X-ray burst associated with FRB 200428. We investigate the PDS continuum properties and find that the distribution of the PDS slope in the simple power-law model peaks $\sim$ 2.5, which is consistent with other magnetars but higher than 5/3 commonly seen in gamma-ray bursts. Besides, the distribution of the break frequency in the broken power-law model peaks at $\sim$ 60 Hz.

In this work, we systematically study the MVTs of hundreds of X-ray bursts (XRBs) from SGR J1935+2154 observed by {\it Insight}-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM from July 2014 to Jan 2022 through the Bayesian Block algorithm. We find that the MVTs peak at $\sim$ 2 ms, corresponding to a light travel time size of about 600 km, which supports the magnetospheric origin in pulsar-like models. The shock radius and the Lorentz factor of the jet are also constrained in GRB-like models. Interestingly, the MVT of the XRB associated with FRB 200428 is $\sim$ 70 ms, which is longer than that of most bursts and implies its special radiation mechanism. Besides, the median of MVTs is 7 ms, shorter than the median MVTs of 40 ms and 480 ms for short GRBs or long GRBs, respectively. However, the MVT is independent of duration, similar to GRBs. Finally, we investigate the energy dependence of MVT and suggest that there is a marginal evidence for a power-law relationship like GRBs but the rate of variation is at least about an order of magnitude smaller. These features may provide an approach to identify bursts with a magnetar origin.",astro-ph.HE

From Initial Conditions to Explosions with Neutrino-radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations,"This paper provides collapses of massive, fully convective, and non-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) formed by accretion-induced collapse or merger-induced collapse and the subsequent explosions with the general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We produce initial WDs in hydrostatic equilibrium, which have super-Chandrasekhar mass and are about to collapse. The WDs have masses of 1.6$M_\odot$ with different initial central densities specifically at $10^{10}$, $10^{9.6}$, $10^{9.3}$ and $10^{9.0}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$. First, we check whether initial WDs are stable without weak interactions. Second, we calculate the collapse of WDs with weak interactions. We employ hydrodynamics simulations with Newtonian gravity in the first and second steps. Third, we calculate the formation of neutron stars and accompanying explosions with general relativistic simulations. As a result, WDs with the highest density of $10^{10}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$ collapse not by weak interactions but by the photodissociation of the iron, and three WDs with low central densities collapse by the electron capture as expected at the second step and succeed in the explosion with a small explosion energy of $\sim 10^{48}$ erg at the third step. By changing the surrounding environment of WDs, we find that there is a minimum value of ejecta masses being $\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$. With the most elaborate simulations of this kind so far, the value is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported values and is compatible with the estimated ejecta mass from FRB~121102.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2306.00092,Jonathan Stern et al.,Accretion onto disk galaxies via hot and rotating CGM inflows,"Observed accretion rates onto the Milky-Way and other local spirals fall short of that required to sustain star formation for cosmological timescales. A potential avenue for this unseen accretion is an inflow in the volume-filling hot phase ($\sim10^6$ K) of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), as suggested by some cosmological simulations. We derive an approximate axisymmetric analytic solution of such hot CGM accretion flows, and validate it with hydrodynamic simulations. We show that a hot inflow spins up as it approaches the galaxy, while remaining hot, subsonic and quasi-spherical. At the radius of angular momentum support ($\approx15$ kpc for the Milky-Way) the hot flow flattens into a disk geometry and then cools from $\sim10^6$ K to $\sim10^4$ K at the disk-halo interface. Cooling affects all hot gas, rather than just a subset of individual gas clouds, implying that accretion via hot inflows does not rely on local thermal instability in contrast with 'precipitation' models for galaxy accretion. Prior to cooling and accretion the inflow completes $\sim t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ radians of rotation, where $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ is the cooling time to free-fall time ratio in hot gas immediately outside the galaxy. The ratio $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ may thus govern the development of turbulence and enhancement of magnetic fields in gas accreting onto low-redshift spirals. We argue that accretion via hot inflows can explain the observed truncation of nearby thin stellar disks at $\approx4$ disk radii. We also show that if rotating hot inflows are common in Milky-Way size disk galaxies, as predicted, then signatures should be observable with X-ray telescopes, kinetic SZ measurements, and FRB surveys.",astro-ph.GA
arXiv:2305.17960,Karen Lee-Waddell et al.,The Host Galaxy of FRB 20171020A Revisited,"The putative host galaxy of FRB 20171020A was first identified as ESO 601-G036 in 2018, but as no repeat bursts have been detected, direct confirmation of the host remains elusive. In light of recent developments in the field, we re-examine this host and determine a new association confidence level of 98%. At 37 Mpc, this makes ESO 601-G036 the third closest FRB host galaxy to be identified to date and the closest to host an apparently non-repeating FRB (with an estimated repetition rate limit of < 0.011 bursts per day above 10 erg). Due to its close distance, we are able to perform detailed multi-wavelength analysis on the ESO 601-G036 system. Follow-up observations confirm ESO 601-G036 to be a typical star-forming galaxy with HI and stellar masses of log(M_HI/M_sol) ~ 9.2 and log(M_*/M_sol) = 8.64, and a star formation rate of SFR = 0.09 +/- 0.01 M_sol/yr. We detect, for the first time, a diffuse gaseous tail (log(M_HI/M_sol) ~ 8.3) extending to the south-west that suggests recent interactions, likely with the confirmed nearby companion ESO 601-G037. ESO 601-G037 is a stellar shred located to the south of ESO 601-G036 that has an arc-like morphology, is about an order of magnitude less massive, and has a lower gas metallicity that is indicative of a younger stellar population. The properties of the ESO 601-G036 system indicate an ongoing minor merger event, which is affecting the overall gaseous component of the system and the stars within ESO 601-G037. Such activity is consistent with current FRB progenitor models involving magnetars and the signs of recent interactions in other nearby FRB host galaxies.",astro-ph.GA

It is found that the peak frequency ($\nu_p$) distribution of the bursts of FRB 20190520B illustrates four discrete peaks in $\sim1-6$ GHz and their spectral width distribution can be fitted with a log-normal function peaking at 0.35 GHz. The discrete $\nu_p$ distribution and the narrow-banded spectral feature are analogous to FRB 20121102A. The burst duration of FRB 20190520B in the rest frame averages 10.72 ms, longer than that of FRB 20121102A by a factor 3. The specific energy ($E_{\rm \mu_{\rm c}}$) at 1.25 GHz of FRB 20190520B observed with the FAST telescope narrowly ranges in $[0.4, 1]\times 10^{38}$ erg, different from the bimodal $E_{\rm \mu_{\rm c}}$ distribution of FRB 20121102A. Assuming a Gaussian spectral profile of the bursts, our Monte Carlo simulation analysis suggests that a power-law (PL) or a cutoff power-law (CPL) energy function can comparably reproduce the $E_{\rm \mu_{\rm c}}$ distribution of FRB 20190520B. The derived energy function index of the PL model is $4.46\pm 0.17$, much steeper than that of FRB 20121102A ($1.82^{+0.10}_{-0.30}$). For the CPL model, we obtain an index of $0.47$ and a cutoff energy of $7.4\times 10^{37}$ erg. Regarding the predicted $\nu_p$ distribution in 1-2 GHz, the CPL model is more preferred than the PL model. These results indicate that FRB 20190520B and FRB 20121102A shares similar spectral properties, but their energy functions are intrinsically different.",astro-ph.HE

Jow, Ue-Li Pen, Daniel Baker, ",On the cusp of cusps: a universal model for extreme scattering events in the ISM,"The scattering structures in the ISM responsible for so-called ``extreme scattering events"" (ESEs), observed in quasars and pulsars, remain enigmatic. Current models struggle to explain the high-frequency light curves of ESEs, and a recent analysis of a double lensing event in PSR\,B0834+06 reveals features of ESEs that may also be challenging to accommodate via existing models. We propose that these features arise naturally when the lens has a cusp-like profile, described by the elementary $A_3$ cusp catastrophe. This is an extension of previous work describing pulsar scintillation as arising from $A_2$ fold catastrophes in thin, corrugated plasma sheets along the line of sight. We call this framework of describing the lens potentials via elementary catastrophes ``doubly catastrophic lensing"", as catastrophes (e.g. folds and cusps) have long been used to describe universal features in the light curves of lensing events that generically manifest, regardless of the precise details of the lens. Here, we argue that the lenses themselves may be described by these same elementary structures. If correct, the doubly catastrophic lensing framework would provide a unified description of scintillation and ESEs, where the lenses responsible for these scattering phenomena are universal and can be fully described by a small number of unfolding parameters. This could enable their application as giant cosmic lenses for precision measurements of coherent sources, including FRBs and pulsars.",astro-ph.HE

This is the first FRB observed by using a Japanese facility. Our detection at 2 GHz in February 2022 is the highest frequency for this FRB and the fluence of $>$ 189 Jy ms is one of the brightest bursts from this FRB source. We place an upper limit on the spectral index $\alpha$ = -2.14 from the detection of the S band and non-detection of the X band at the same time. We compare an event rate of the detected burst with ones of the previous research, and suggest that the power-law of the luminosity function might be broken at lower fluence, and the fluences of bright FRBs distribute up to over 2 GHz with the power-law against frequency. In addition, we show the energy density of the burst detected in this work was comparable to the bright population of one-off FRBs. We propose that repeating FRBs can be as bright as one-off FRBs, and only their brightest bursts could be detected so some of repeating FRBs intrinsically might have been classified as one-off FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2210.13506,Alexander Y. Chen et al.,Propagation of a Strong Fast Magnetosonic Wave in the Magnetosphere of a Neutron Star,"We study the propagation of a strong, low frequency, linearly polarized fast magnetosonic wave inside the magnetosphere of a neutron star. The relative strength $\delta B/B$ of the wave grows as a function of radius before it reaches the light cylinder, and what starts as a small perturbation can grow to become nonlinear before it escapes the magnetosphere. Using first-principles Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, we study in detail the evolution of the wave as it becomes nonlinear. We find that an initially sinusoidal wave becomes strongly distorted as $\delta B/B$ approaches order unity. The wave steepens into a shock in each wavelength. The plasma particles drift into the shock and undergo coherent gyration in the rest of the wave, and subsequently become thermalized. This process quickly dissipates the energy of an FRB emitted deep within the magnetosphere of magnetar, effectively preventing GHz waves produced in the closed field line zone from escaping. This mechanism may also provide an effective way to launch shocks in the magnetosphere from kHz fast magnetosonic waves without requiring a relativistic ejecta. The resulting shock can propagate to large distances and may produce FRBs as a synchrotron maser.",astro-ph.HE

The large FOV allows CHIME/FRB to be an exceptional pulsar and Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) finding machine, despite saving only the metadata of incoming Galactic events. We have developed a pipeline to search for pulsar/RRAT candidates using DBSCAN, a clustering algorithm. Follow-up observations are then scheduled with the more sensitive CHIME/Pulsar instrument capable of near-daily high time resolution spectra observations. We have developed the CHIME/Pulsar Single Pulse Pipeline to automate the processing of CHIME/Pulsar search-mode data. We report the discovery of 21 new Galactic sources, with 14 RRATs, 6 isolated long-period pulsars and 1 binary system. Owing to CHIME/Pulsar's observations we have obtained timing solutions for 8 of the 14 RRATs along with all the regular pulsars and the binary system. Notably we report that the binary system is in a long orbit of 412 days with a minimum companion mass of 0.1303 solar masses and no evidence of an optical companion within 10"" of the pulsar position. This highlights that working synergistically with CHIME/FRB's large survey volume CHIME/Pulsar can obtain arc second localisations for low burst rate RRATs though pulsar timing. We find that the properties of our newly discovered RRATs are consistent with those of the presently known population. They tend to have lower burst rates than those found in previous surveys, which is likely due to survey bias rather than the underlying population.",astro-ph.HE

Provided that $z$ is inferred from the measured extra-galactic dispersion measure $DM_{\rm Ex}$, the fluence $F$ of the observed event defines a track in $(\alpha, E_{33})$ space which we refer to as the ""energy track"". Here we consider the energy tracks for a sample of $254$ non-repeating low dispersion measure FRBs from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1, and use these to determine $n(E_{33} \mid \alpha)$ the conditional energy distribution i.e. the number of FRBs in the interval $\Delta E_{33}$ given a value of $\alpha$. Considering $-10 \le \alpha \le 10$, we find that the entire energy scale shifts to higher energy values as $\alpha$ is increased. For all values of $\alpha$, we can identify two distinct energy ranges indicating that there are possibly two distinct FRB populations. At high energies, the distribution is well fitted by a modified Schechter function whose slope and characteristic energy both increase with $\alpha$. At low energies, the number of FRBs are in excess of the predictions of the modified Schechter function indicating that we may have a distinctly different population of low-energy FRBs. We have checked that our main findings are reasonably robust to the assumptions regarding the Galactic Halo and Host galaxy contributions to the dispersion measure.",astro-ph.HE

The burst consists of three components, the brightest of which has an intrinsic width of only 11.3 $\mu$s and a scattering tail with an exponentially decaying time-scale of 21.4 $\mu$s measured at 835 MHz. We model the sensitivity of UTMOST and other major FRB surveys to such narrow events. We find that $>60\%$ of FRBs like FRB20191107B are being missed, and that a significant population of very narrow FRBs probably exists and remains underrepresented in these surveys. The high DM and small scattering timescale of FRB20191107B allows us to place an upper limit on the strength of turbulence in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM), quantified as scattering measure (SM), of ${\rm SM_{IGM} < 8.4 \times 10^{-7} ~kpc~m^{-20/3}}$. Almost all UTMOST FRBs have full phase information due to real-time voltage capture which provides us with the largest sample of coherently dedispersed single burst FRBs. Our 10.24 $\mu$s time resolution data yields accurately measured FRB scattering timescales. We combine the UTMOST FRBs with 10 FRBs from the literature and find no obvious evidence for a DM-scattering relation, suggesting that IGM is not the dominant source of scattering in FRBs. We support the results of previous studies and identify the local environment of the source in the host galaxy as the most likely region which dominates the observed scattering of our FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

Previous studies show that there is possible period about 230 day in SGR J1935+2154 bursts. Here, we collected an updated burst sample from SGR J1935+2154, including all bursts reported by Fermi/GBM and GECAM till 2022 January. We also developed a targeted search pipeline to reveal more bursts from SGR J1935+2154 in the Fermi/GBM data from 2008 August to 2014 December (i.e. before the first burst detected by Swift/BAT). With this burst sample, we re-analyzed the possible periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts using the Period Folding and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram methods. Our results show that the periodicity $\sim$238 day reported in literature is probably fake and the observation effects may introduce false periods (i.e. 55 day) according to simulation tests. We find that, for the current burst sample, the most probable period is 126.88$\pm$2.05 day, which could be interpreted as the precession of the magnetar.

Yet no such infrequent repetitions (in contrast to the frequent activity of FRB known to repeat) have been observed, constraining their repetition rates and active lifetimes. The absence of more frequent weaker but detectable repetitive outbursts in apparent non-repeaters resembles the distribution of SGR outbursts, with a large gap between giant outbursts and lesser outbursts. This suggests mini-SGR as sources, more energetic than SGR 1935$+$2154 associated with FRB 200428 but less energetic than SGR 1806$-$20 that had no associated FRB. Their largest radio outbursts would, at cosmological distances, be apparently non-repeating FRB and their X-ray and gamma-ray outbursts would be undetectable.

A sample of 75 bursts detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope shows scattering on two scales: a mean temporal delay $\tau(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=10.9\pm1.5$ ms, which is attributed to the host galaxy, and a mean scintillation bandwidth $\nu_{\rm d}(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=0.21\pm0.01$ MHz, which is attributed to the Milky Way. Balmer line measurements for the host imply an H$\alpha$ emission measure (galaxy frame) $\rm EM_s=620$ pc cm$^{-6} \times (T/10^4 {\rm K})^{0.9}$, implying $\rm DM_{\rm H\alpha}$ of order the value inferred from the FRB DM budget, $\rm DM_h=1121^{+89}_{-138}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for plasma temperatures greater than the typical value $10^4$ K. Combining $\tau$ and $\rm DM_h$ yields a nominal constraint on the scattering amplification from the host galaxy $\tilde{F} G=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}$ (pc$^2$ km)$^{-1/3}$, where $\tilde{F}$ describes turbulent density fluctuations and $G$ represents the geometric leverage to scattering that depends on the location of the scattering material. For a two-screen scattering geometry where $\tau$ arises from the host galaxy and $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$ from the Milky Way, the implied distance between the FRB source and dominant scattering material is $\lesssim100$ pc. The host galaxy scattering and DM contributions support a novel technique for estimating FRB redshifts using the $\tau-\rm DM$ relation, and are consistent with previous findings that scattering of localized FRBs is largely dominated by plasma within host galaxies and the Milky Way.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2202.10519,A. V. Plavin et al.,FRB 121102: drastic changes in the burst polarization contrasts with the stability of the persistent emission,"We study milliarcsecond-scale properties of the persistent radio counterpart to FRB 121102 and investigate the spectro-polarimetric properties of a bright burst. For the former, we use European VLBI Network (EVN) observations in 2017 at 1.7 and 4.8 GHz. For the latter, we re-analyse the 1.7-GHz data from the 100-m Effelseberg telescope taken in 2016. These observations predate other polarimetric studies of FRB 121102, and yield the highest burst Faraday rotation measure (RM) to date, RM = 1.27*10^5 rad m^-2, consistent with the decreasing RM trend. The fractional polarization of the burst emission is 15% at 1.7 GHz. This can be reconciled with the high fractional polarization at higher frequencies if the Faraday width of the burst environment is 150 rad m^-2 - a bare 0.1% of the total Faraday rotation. The width may originate from minor non-uniformities in the Faraday screen, or from effects in the emitting region itself. The upper limit on the persistent source size is 1 pc, barely consistent with a young supernova (SN) scenario. The flux variability limit of <10% is not in favor of the young SN scenario, and challenges other interpretations as well. The fractional polarization of the faint persistent source is constrained at <25% at 4.8 GHz ruling out a common origin with the highly polarized individual bursts.",astro-ph.HE

Observations were conducted as part of our regular campaign to monitor activity and evolution of burst properties. The 10 reported observations were carried out between 1150 and 1730 MHz and fall in the active period around November 2018. All bursts were dedispersed at the same dispersion measure and are consistent with a single value of 562.4(1) pc/cm$^3$. The rate varies between 0 bursts and 218(16) bursts per hour, the highest rate observed to date. The times between consecutive bursts show a bimodal distribution. We find that a Poisson process with varying rate best describes arrival times with separations >0.1 s. Clustering on timescales of 22 ms reflects a characteristic timescale of the source and possibly the emission mechanism. We analyse the spectro-temporal structure of the bursts by fitting 2D Gaussians with a temporal drift to each sub-burst in the dynamic spectra. We find a linear relationship between the sub-burst's drift and its duration. At the same time, the drifts are consistent with coming from the sad-trombone effect. This has not been predicted by current models. The energy distribution shows an excess of high energy bursts and is insufficiently modelled by a single power-law even within single observations. We find long-term changes in the energy distribution, the average spectrum, and the sad-trombone drift, compared to earlier and later published observations. Despite the large burst rate, we find no strict short-term periodicity.",astro-ph.HE

This number constitutes the total signal events, which is then compared to the total background, corresponding to the null hypothesis of no spatial association. The background was obtained from the total neutrino-FRB matches in off-source angular windows with the same solid angle as the signal window. We do not find any statistically significant excess compared to the background. Therefore, we conclude that there is no evidence for an angular correlation between the IceCube neutrinos in the TeV energy range and CHIME FRBs. For each of these searches, we report 90% Bayesian credible interval upper limits on the observed FRB-induced neutrinos.",astro-ph.HE

We study possible neutrino emission from FRB-emitting magnetars by developing a general theoretical framework. We consider three different sites for proton acceleration and neutrino emission, i.e. within the magnetosphere, in the current sheet region beyond the light cylinder, and in relativistic shocks far away from the magnetosphere. Different cooling processes for protons and pions are considered to calculate the neutrino emission suppression factor within each scenario. We find that the flux of the neutrino emission decreases with increasing radius from the magnetar due to the decrease of the target photon number density. We calculate the neutrino flux from FRB 200428 and its associated X-ray burst. The flux of the most optimistic case invoking magnetospheric proton acceleration is still $\sim4$ orders of magnitude below the IceCube sensitivity. We also estimate the diffuse neutrino background from all FRB-emitting magnetars in the universe. The total neutrino flux of magnetars during their FRB emission phases is a negligible fraction of observed diffuse emission even under the most optimistic magnetospheric scenario for neutrino emission. However, if one assumes that many more X-ray bursts without FRB associations can also produce neutrinos with similar mechanisms, magnetars can contribute up to $10^{-8} \ {\rm GeV \ s^{-1} \ sr^{-1} \ cm^{-2}}$ diffuse neutrino background flux in the GeV to multi-TeV range.",astro-ph.HE

We report the first-ever detection of the source in the 800-1000 MHz range along with one of the widest instantaneous bandwidth detection (200 MHz) at lower frequencies. We identify 30 $\mu$s wide structures in one of the bursts at 800 MHz, making it the lowest frequency detection of such structures for this FRB thus far. There is also a clear indication of high activity of the source at a higher frequency during earlier phases of the activity cycle. We identify a gradual decrease in the rotation measure over two years and no significant variations in the dispersion measure. We derive useful conclusions about progenitor scenarios, energy distribution, emission mechanisms, and variation of downward drift rate of emission with frequency. Our results reinforce that multiband observations are an effective approach to study repeaters and even one-off events to better understand their varying activity and spectral anomalies.",astro-ph.HE

Swift/BAT is the most sensitive GRB detector in operation, and the only one that regularly localizes GRBs to arcminute precision, critical to rapid followup studies. However, the utility of BAT in targeted sub-threshold searches had been historically curtailed by the unavailability of the necessary raw data for analysis. The new availability of time-tagged event (TTE) data from the GUANO system (arXiv:2005.01751), motivates renewed focus on developing sensitive targeted search analysis techniques to maximally exploit these data. While computationally cheap, we show that the typical coded-mask deconvolution imaging is limited in its sensitivity due to several factors. We formalize a maximum likelihood framework for the analysis of BAT data wherein signals are forward modelled through the full instrument response, and -- coupled with the development of new response models -- demonstrate its superior sensitivity to typical imaging via archival comparisons, injection campaigns, and, after implementing as a targeted search, a large number of low-latency GRB discoveries and confirmed arcminute localizations to date. We also demonstrate independent localization of some out-of-FOV GRBs for the first time. NITRATES's increased sensitivity boosts the discovery rate of GRB 170817A-like events in BAT by a factor of at least $3-4$x, along with enabling joint analyses and searches with other GRB, GW, neutrino, and FRB instruments.

Using simulations, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis to determine the FRB population model which best fits this data. Our analysis shows that models where the pulse scatter broadening increases moderately with redshift ($z$) are preferred over those where this increases very sharply or where scattering is absent. Further, models where the comoving event rate density is constant over $z$ are preferred over those where it follows the cosmological star formation rate. Two models for the host dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm host}$) distribution (a fixed and a random $DM_{\rm host}$) are found to predict comparable results.

We observed the source with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at 1.36 GHz on 9 April 2021 and detected 20 bursts. A downward drift in frequency over time is clearly seen from the majority of bursts in our sample. A structure-maximizing dispersion measure (DM) search on the multi-component bursts in our sample yields a DM of 411.6$\pm$0.6 pc/cm$^3$. We find that the rotation measure (RM) of the bursts varies around their mean value of -605 rad/m$^2$ with a standard deviation of 11.1 rad/m$^2$. This RM magnitude is 10 times larger than the expected Galactic contribution along this line of sight (LoS). We estimate a LoS magnetic field strength of 4--6 $\mu$G, assuming that the entire host galaxy DM contributes to the RM. Further polarization measurements will help determine FRB 20201124A's RM stability. The bursts are highly linearly polarized, with some showing signs of circular polarization, the first for a repeating FRB. Their polarization position angles (PAs) are flat across the burst envelopes and vary between bursts. We argue that the varying polarization fractions and PAs of FRB 20201124A are similar to known magnetospheric emission from pulsars, while the observed circular polarization, combined with the RM variability, is hard to explain with Faraday conversion. The high linear polarization fractions, flat PAs, and downward drift from FRB 20201124A bursts are similar to previous repeating sources, while the observed circular polarization is a newly seen behaviour among repeaters.",astro-ph.HE

We depict in a single diagram all objects from radio pulsars and dwarf novae to ultra luminous X-ray sources and a radio pulsating white dwarf. This diagram directly demonstrates the genetic link between different types of compact sources thereby making it possible to confirm and illustrate clearly the established evolutionary connections - such as that between bulge X-ray sources and millisecond pulsars. This approach allows us to understand the evolutionary status of Ultra Luminous X-ray sources. In addition, we propose an additional evolutionary branch of the formation of Magnetars.

The wide contiguous bandwidth of these observations have revealed a complex bifurcating structure in some bursts at $1250$ MHz. When de-dispersed to their structure-optimised dispersion measures, two of the bursts show a clear deviation from the cold plasma dispersion relationship below $1250$ MHz. We find a differential dispersion measure of ${\sim}1{-}2$ pc cm$^{-3}$ between the lower and higher frequency regions of each burst. We investigate the possibility of plasma lensing by Gaussian lenses of ${\sim}10$ AU in the host galaxy, and demonstrate that they can qualitatively produce some of the observed burst morphologies. Other possible causes for the observed frequency dependence, such as Faraday delay, are also discussed. Unresolved sub-components in the bursts, however, may have led to an incorrect DM determination. We hence advise exercising caution when considering bursts in isolation. We analyse the presence of two apparent burst pairs. One of these pairs is a potential example of upward frequency drift. The possibility that burst pairs are echoes is also discussed. The average structure-optimised dispersion measure is found to be $563.5\pm 0.2 (\text{sys}) \pm 0.8 (\text{stat})$ pc cm$^{-3}$ $-$ consistent with the values reported in 2018. We use two independent methods to determine the structure-optimised dispersion measure of the bursts: the DM_phase algorithm and autocorrelation functions.

We used the high-significance detection of FRB 180309 with the Parkes Telescope and a beam model of the Parkes Multibeam Receiver to improve the localization of the FRB to a region spanning approximately $\sim2'\times2'$. We aimed to seek bright galaxies within this region to determine the strongest candidates as the originator of this highly luminous FRB. We identified optical sources within the localization region above our r-band magnitude limit of 24.27, fourteen of which have photometric redshifts whose fitted mean is consistent with the redshift upper limit ($z < 0.32$) of our FRB. Two of these galaxies are coincident with marginally detected ""persistent"" radio sources of flux density 24.3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and 22.1$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. Our redshift-dependent limit on the luminosity of any associated persistent radio source is comparable to the luminosity limits for other localized FRBs. We analyze several properties of the candidate hosts we identified, including chance association probability, redshift, and presence of radio emission, however it remains possible that any of these galaxies could be the host of this FRB.

arXiv:2101.11622,"Hagai B. Perets, Paz Beniamini, ",No velocity-kicks are required to explain large-distance offsets of Ca-rich supernovae and short-GRBs,"The environments of explosive transients link their progenitors to the underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins. However, some Ca-rich supernovae (SNe) and short gamma ray burst (sGRBs) appear to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large velocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in dense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the large spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the observations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early type) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo globular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and no/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar populations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and consequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified by our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions in early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and late type galaxies, the offsets' distributions of the different transients are consistent with each other. Finally, we point out that studies of other transients' offset distribution (e.g. Ia-SNe or FRBs) should similarly consider the host galaxy-type.",astro-ph.HE

The DM induced by hosts deviates from a log-normal distribution, but exhibits an extended distribution in the range of $1-3000 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$ with a median value $\sim 100 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$. Then we produce mock FRB sources, assuming a uniform distribution in the range $z\sim 0-0.82$, to consider the propagation effect of IGM, foreground and host halos on FRB signals simultaneously. The DM distribution of mock sources agrees well with the observation. The fitted DM-redshift relation of the mock sources can provide a rough estimation of the redshifts of observed events with errors $\delta z \lesssim 0.15$. The distribution of mock sources in the DM-scattering time($\tau$) space can also match the observation, assuming a Kolmogorov turbulence model with the inner and outer scale is 1000 km to 1 AU, and 0.2-10 pc respectively. Finally, we estimate the relative importance of these medium on DM and $\tau$ in our models. The IGM and host halos are the primary and secondary sources to the extragalactic DM, $\rm{DM_{exg}}$. Meanwhile, the contribution from foreground halos increases as $\rm{DM_{exg}}$ increases. The host and foreground halos may be the most important medium for scattering. Statistically, the latter may dominate the scattering of events with $\rm{DM_{exg}} \gtrsim 200 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$.",astro-ph.HE

Many theoretical models of binary neutron stars mergers predict that bright, prompt radio emission would accompany the merger. The detection of such prompt emission would greatly improve our knowledge of the physical conditions, environment, and location of the merger. However, searches for prompt emission are complicated by the relatively poor localisation for gravitational wave events, with the 90\% credible region reaching hundreds or even thousands of square degrees. Operating in fly's eye mode, the ASKAP field of view can reach $\sim$1000 deg$^2$ at $\sim 888\,{\rm MHz}$. This potentially allows observers to cover most of the 90\% credible region quickly enough to detect prompt emission. We use skymaps for GW170817 and GW190814 from LIGO/Virgo's third observing run to simulate the probability of detecting prompt emission for gravitational wave events in the upcoming fourth observing run. With only alerts released after merger we find it difficult to slew the telescope sufficiently quickly as to capture any prompt emission. However, with the addition of alerts released \textit{before} merger by negative-latency pipelines we find that it should be possible to search for nearby, bright prompt FRB-like emission from gravitational wave events. Nonetheless, the rates are low: we would expect to observe $\sim$0.012 events during the fourth observing run, assuming that the prompt emission is emitted microseconds around the merger",astro-ph.IM

We observed the source at 550-750 MHz for $\sim 2$ hours each during three successive cycles at the peak of its expected active period. We find 0, 12, and 3 bursts respectively, implying a highly variable bursting rate even within the active phase. We consistently detect faint bursts with spectral energies only an order of magnitude higher than the Galactic burst source SGR~1935+2154. The times of arrival of the detected bursts rule out many possible aliased solutions, strengthening the findings of the 16.35-day periodicity. A short-timescale periodicity search returned no highly significant candidates. Two of the beamformer-detected bursts were bright enough to be clearly detected in the imaging data, achieving sub-arcsecond localization, and proving as a proof-of-concept for FRB imaging with the GMRT. We provide a $3\sigma$ upper limit of the persistent radio flux density at 650 MHz of $66~\mu{\rm Jy}$ which, combined with the EVN and VLA limits at 1.6~GHz, further constrains any potential radio counterpart. These results demonstrate the power of uGMRT for targeted observations to detect and localize known repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2006.16480,"Bruce Grossan, ",Possible Periodic Windowed Behavior in SGR1935+2154 SGR Bursts,"Two repeating FRB sources, FRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020a) and FRB121102 (Rajwade, et al., 2020, Cruces, et al., 2021) display periodic windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. In PWB, events only occur within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period, but no events may occur during many of the periods. During UT 2020 April 28, two peaks of a soft gamma burst (Li, et al., 2021) were identified with two FRB peaks (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, et al., 2020b) from soft gamma repeater (SGR) 1935+2154. As SGRs are a type of magnetar, these observations establish a link between at least some FRBs and magnetars. The analysis herein, which selects the period giving the minimum window fraction, shows PWB in this source's soft gamma-ray emission. For 161 bursts from 2014 through 2020 from IPN (Interplanetary Network) instruments, a clearly resolved minimum in window fraction vs. period occurs at a 231 +/- 9 day period, and 55 \% window fraction. The data cover only 6 bursting episodes, however, the periodicity result appears relatively robust: First, the IPN has excellent time coverage and is unlikely to miss bursts outside of these windows. Second, for various data subsets (with significantly less bursts), either the best or second best measured period was consistent with 231 days, even in the sub-sample with the richest bursting episode removed. In addition, simulations show that even small numbers of uniform random bursts do not show PWB, and that the results are not due to limited sampling. The apparent PWB could have alternative explanations; a firm conclusion of PWB would be evident, however, after the observation of more consistent episodes. If the periodicity of this SGR's bursts can be verified, and if similar behavior were observed in other repeating FRB sources, it might suggest a linkage between FRB and SGR burst mechanisms or emission conditions.",astro-ph.HE

Many models propose that the periodically repeating FRBs might be related to binary star systems that contain at least one neutron star (NSC-FRB system). It has been suggested that the NS ""combed"" by the strong wind from a companion star might provide a solution. Following the ""Binary Comb"" model, we use the population synthesis method to study in detail the properties of the companion stars and the nature of NSC-FRB systems. Our main findings are: 1) the companion star is most likely to be a B-type star; 2) the period of 16 days of FRB 180916 happens to fall in the most probable period range, which may explain why FRB 180916 was the first detected periodically repeating FRB, and we expect to observe more periodically repeating FRBs with periods around 10-30 days; 3) the birth rate for NSC-FRB system is large enough to fulfill the event rate requirement set by the observation of FRB 180916, which supports the proposal that NSC-FRB can provide one significant channel for producing periodically repeating FRBs.",astro-ph.HE

The detections were made using the newly deployed MeerTRAP system and single pulse detection pipeline at the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. Fortuitously, the Nancay radio telescope observations on this day overlapped with the last hour of MeerKAT observations and resulted in 4 simultaneous detections. The observations with MeerKAT's wide band receiver, which extends down to relatively low frequencies (900-1670 MHz usable L-band range), have allowed us to get a detailed look at the complex frequency structure, intensity variations and frequency-dependent sub-pulse drifting. The drift rates we measure for the full-band and sub-banded data are consistent with those published between 600-6500 MHz with a slope of -0.147 +/- 0.014 ms^-1. Two of the detected bursts exhibit fainter 'precursors' separated from the brighter main pulse by ~28 ms and ~34 ms. A follow-up multi-telescope campaign on the 6th and 8th October 2019 to better understand these frequency drifts and structures over a wide and continuous band was undertaken. No detections resulted, indicating that the source was 'inactive' over a broad frequency range during this time.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2006.03468,"J. I. Katz, ",The FRB-SGR Connection,"The discovery that the Galactic SGR 1935$+$2154 emitted FRB 200428 simultaneous with a gamma-ray flare demonstrated the common source and association of these phenomena. If FRB radio emission is the result of coherent curvature radiation, the net charge of the radiating ""bunches"" or waves may be inferred from the radiated fields, independent of the mechanism by which the bunches are produced. A statistical argument indicates that the radiating bunches must have a Lorentz factor $\gtrapprox 10$. The observed radiation frequencies indicate that their phase velocity (pattern speed) corresponds to Lorentz factors $\gtrapprox 100$. Coulomb repulsion implies that the electrons making up these bunches may have yet larger Lorentz factors, limited by their incoherent curvature radiation. These electrons also Compton scatter the soft gamma-rays of the SGR. In FRB 200428 the power radiated coherently at radio frequencies exceeded that of Compton scattering, but in more luminous SGR outbursts Compton scattering dominates, precluding the acceleration of energetic electrons. This explains the absence of a FRB associated with the giant 27 December 2004 outburst of SGR 1806$-$20. SGR with luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{42}$ ergs/s do not emit FRB, while those of lesser luminosity can do so. ""Superbursts"" like FRB 200428 are produced when narrowly collimated FRB are aligned with the line of sight; they are unusual, but not rare, and ""cosmological"" FRB may be superbursts.",astro-ph.HE

The burst has a large dispersion measure ($DM_{FRB}=339.8$ $pc/cm^3$) compared to the expected cosmic average at its redshift. It also has a large rotation measure ($RM_{FRB}=353$ $rad/m^2$) and scattering timescale ($\tau=3.3$ $ms$ at $1.28$ $GHz$). Chittidi et al (2020) perform a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and optical emission of the host galaxy and estimate the host DM contribution to be $110\pm 37$ $pc/cm^3$. This work complements theirs and reports the analysis of the optical data of galaxies in the foreground of FRB 190608 to explore their contributions to the FRB signal. Together, the two manuscripts delineate an observationally driven, end-to-end study of matter distribution along an FRB sightline; the first study of its kind. Combining KCWI observations and public SDSS data, we estimate the expected cosmic dispersion measure $DM_{cosmic}$ along the sightline to FRB 190608. We first estimate the contribution of hot, ionized gas in intervening virialized halos ($DM_{halos} \approx 7-28$ $pc/cm^3$). Then, using the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) methodology, we produce a 3D map of ionized gas in cosmic web filaments and compute the DM contribution from matter outside halos ($DM_{IGM} \approx 91-126$ $pc/cm^3$). This implies a greater fraction of ionized gas along this sightline is extant outside virialized halos. We also investigate whether the intervening halos can account for the large FRB rotation measure and pulse width and conclude that it is implausible. Both the pulse broadening and the large Faraday rotation likely arise from the progenitor environment or the host galaxy.",astro-ph.GA

The SNR hosts the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which emitted an extremely bright ms-duration radio burst on 2020 Apr 28 (The Chime/Frb Collaboration et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020). We used the 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Image Scroll Painting (MWISP) CO line survey to search for molecular gas associated with G57.2+0.8, in order to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., the distance) of the SNR and its magnetar. We report that SNR G57.2+0.8 is likely impacting the molecular clouds (MCs) at the local standard of rest (LSR) velocity V_{LSR} ~ 30 km/s and excites a weak 1720 MHz OH maser with a peak flux density of 47 mJy/beam. The chance coincidence of a random OH spot falling in the SNR is <12%, and the OH-CO correspondence chance is 7% at the maser spot. This combines to give < 1% false probability of the OH maser, suggesting a real maser detection. The LSR velocity of the MCs places the SNR and magnetar at a kinematic distance of d=6.6 +/- 0.7 kpc. The nondetection of thermal X-ray emission from the SNR and the relatively dense environment suggests G57.2+0.8 be an evolved SNR with an age $t>1.6 \times 10^4$ (d/6.6 kpc) yr. The explosion energy of G57.2+0.8 is lower than $2 \times 10^{51}(n_0/10 cm^{-3})^{1.16} (d/~6.6 kpc)^{3.16}$ erg, which is not very energetic even assuming a high ambient density $n_0$ = 10 cm$^{-3}$.

These event data are not continuously available due to the large telemetry load, but are critical to recovering weak or sub-threshold GRBs that are not triggered onboard, such as the likely counterparts to GW-detected off-axis binary neutron star mergers. We show that the availability of event data can effectively increase the rate of detections, and arcminute localizations, of GRB 170817-like bursts by >400%. We describe a spacecraft commanding pipeline purpose built to enable this science; to our knowledge the first fully autonomous extremely-low-latency commanding of a space telescope for scientific purposes. This pipeline has been successfully run in its complete form since early 2020, and has resulted in the recovery of BAT event data for >700 externally triggered events to date (GWs, neutrinos, GRBs triggered by other facilities, FRBs), now running with a success rate of ~90%. We exemplify the utility of this new capability by using the resultant data to (1) set the most sensitive (8 sigma) upper limits of $8.1\times10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (14-195 keV) on prompt 1s duration short GRB-like emission within $\pm$ 15s of the unmodelled GW burst candidate S200114f, and (2) provide arcminute localizations for short GRB 200325A and other bursts. We show that using data from GUANO to localize GRBs discovered elsewhere, we can increase the net rate of arcminute localized GRBs by 10-20% per year. Along with the scientific yield of more sensitive searches for sub-threshold GRBs, the new capabilities designed for this project will enable further rapid response Target of Opportunity capabilities for Swift, and have implications for the design of future rapid-response space telescopes.",astro-ph.HE

Corresponding objects - Bose (axion) stars, their clusters, and clouds of diffuse axions - form abundantly in the postinflationary Peccei-Quinn scenario. We develop general description of parametric resonance incorporating finite-volume effects, backreaction, axion velocities and their (in)coherence. With additional coarse-graining, our formalism reproduces kinetic equation for virialized axions interacting with photons. We derive conditions for the parametric instability in each of the above objects, as well as in collapsing axion stars, evaluate photon resonance modes and their growth exponents. As a by-product, we calculate stimulated emission of Bose stars and diffuse axions, arguing that the former can give larger contribution into the radiobackground. In the case of QCD axions, the Bose stars glow and collapsing stars radioburst if the axion-photon coupling exceeds the original KSVZ value by two orders of magnitude. The latter constraint is alleviated for several nearby axion stars in resonance and absent for axion-like particles.

The wave amplitude at the magnetar surface should be about 1011G in order to produce a FRB of isotropic luminosity 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. An electric current along the static magnetic field is required by Alfven waves with nonzero component of transverse wave-vector. The current is supplied by counter-streaming electron-positron pairs, which have to move at nearly the speed of light at larger radii as the plasma density decreases with distance from the magnetar surface. The counter-streaming pairs are subject to two-stream instability which leads to the formation of particle bunches of size of order $c/\omega_p$; where $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency. A strong electric field develops along the static magnetic field when the wave packet arrives at a radius where electron-positron density is insufficient to supply the current required by the wave. The electric field accelerates particle bunches along the curved magnetic field lines, and that produces the coherent FRB radiation. We provide a number of predictions of this model.",astro-ph.HE
arXiv:2002.07304,"Steven Tingay, ",High Cadence Optical Transient Searches using Drift Scan Imaging I: Proof of Concept with a Pre-Prototype System,"An imaging technique with sensitivity to short duration optical transients is described. The technique is based on the use of wide-field cameras operating in a drift scanning mode, whereby persistent objects produce trails on the sensor and short duration transients occupy localised groups of pixels. A benefit of the technique is that sensitivity to short duration signals is not accompanied by massive data rates, because the exposure time >> transient duration. The technique is demonstrated using a pre-prototype system composed of readily available and inexpensive commercial components, coupled with common coding environments, commercially available software, and free web-based services. The performance of the technique and the pre-prototype system is explored, including aspects of photometric and astrometric calibration, detection sensitivity, characterisation of candidate transients, and the differentiation of astronomical signals from non-astronomical signals (primarily glints from satellites in Earth orbit and cosmic ray hits on sensor pixels). Test observations were made using the pre-prototype system, achieving sensitivity to transients with 21 ms duration, resulting in the detection of five candidate transients. An investigation of these candidates concludes they are most likely due to cosmic ray hits on the sensor and/or satellites. The sensitivity obtained with the pre-prototype system is such that, under some models for the optical emission from FRBs, the detection of a typical FRB, such as FRB181228, to a distance of approximately 100 Mpc is plausible. Several options for improving the system/technique in the future are described.",astro-ph.IM

We find that the pulse energy distribution follows a power law with index $\alpha\approx$-3 at least up to a fluence of ~5 Jy s. The power law index agrees well with that found for lower energy pulses in the range 3-30 Jy ms. The fluence distribution of the Crab pulsar hence appears to follow a single power law over ~3 orders of magnitude in fluence. We do not see any evidence for the flattening at high fluences reported by earlier studies. We also find that at these fluence levels, the rate of giant-pulse emission varies by as much as a factor of ~5 on time-scales of a few days, although the power law index of the pulse-energy distribution remains unchanged. The slope of the fluence distribution for Crab giant pulses is similar to that recently determined for the repeating FRB 121102.

If the jets are Poynting flux dominated rather than baryon dominated, a coherent radio flare from magnetic re-connection events might be expected with the prompt gamma-ray emission. There are two competing models for the central engines of GRBs; a black hole or a newly formed milli-second magnetar. If the central engine is a magnetar it is predicted to produce coherent radio emission as persistent or flaring activity. In this paper, we present the deepest limits to date for this emission following LOFAR rapid response observations of GRB 180706A. No emission is detected to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 1.7 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz in a two-hour LOFAR observation starting 4.5 minutes after the gamma-ray trigger.

The typical scatter broadening of the intrinsic pulse is found to be considerably small $\lesssim 10^{-2}-1\ {\rm ms}$ from physical models, with the ISM contribution suppressed significantly relative to IGM. The intrinsic width for non-repeating FRBs is broadened by a factor $\sim 2-3$ on average primarily due to dispersive smearing. From the simulations, we find that the host galaxy DM contribution is likely to be comparable to the Galactic contribution and the FRB energy decreases significantly at high frequencies with a negative spectral index. The FRB spatial density is found to increase up to redshift $\sim 2.0$ and then drops significantly at larger distances.

This represents the first detection of radio emission coincident with a SLSN on any timescale. We investigate various scenarios for the origin of the radio emission: star formation activity, an active galactic nucleus, and a non-relativistic supernova blastwave. While any of these would be quite novel if confirmed, none appear likely when taken in context of the other properties of the host galaxy, previous radio observations of SLSNe, and the general population of hydrogen-poor SNe. Instead, the radio emission is reminiscent of the quiescent radio source associated with the repeating FRB 121102, which has been argued to be powered by a magnetar born in a SLSN or LGRB explosion several decades ago. We show that the properties of the radio source are consistent with a magnetar wind nebula or an off-axis jet, indicating the presence of a central engine.

In this paper we develop and apply a formalism that extends geometrical optics to describe the effects of two dimensional plasma lenses of arbitrary shape. We apply insights from catastrophe theory and the study of uniform asymptotic expansions of integrals to describe the lensing amplification close to fold caustics and in shadow regions, and explore the effects of image appearance and disappearance at caustics in the time of arrival (TOA) perturbations due to lensing. The enhanced geometric optics approach successfully reproduces the predictions from wave optics and can be efficiently used to simulate multifrequency TOA residuals during lensing events. Lensing will introduce perturbations both in the way the residuals change as a function of frequency and also in the magnitude and sign of the residuals averaged over a frequency band. The deviations from the expected dispersive $\nu^{-2}$ scaling will be most significant when including observations at low frequencies. We examine the consequences of lensing in the context of precision pulsar timing and touch on its potential relevance to the study of FRBs.",astro-ph.CO
arXiv:1810.08933,Lei Liu et al.,The localization of single pulse in VLBI observation,"In our previous work, we propose a cross spectrum based method to extract single pulse signals from RFI contaminated data, which is originated from geodetic VLBI postprocessing. This method fully utilizes fringe phase information of the cross spectrum and hence maximizes signal power, however the localization was not discussed in that work yet. As the continuation of that work, in this paper, we further study how to localize single pulses using astrometric solving method. Assuming that the burst is a point source, we derive the burst position by solving a set of linear equations given the relation between residual delay and offset to a priori position. We find that the single pulse localization results given by both astrometric solving and radio imaging are consistent within 3 sigma level. Therefore we claim that it is possible to derive the position of a single pulse with reasonable precision based on only 3 or even 2 baselines with 4 milliseconds integration. The combination of cross spectrum based detection and the localization proposed in this work then provide a thorough solution for searching single pulse in VLBI observation. According to our calculation, our pipeline gives comparable accuracy as radio imaging pipeline. Moreover, the computational cost of our pipeline is much smaller, which makes it more practical for FRB search in regular VLBI observation. The pipeline is now publicly available and we name it as ""VOLKS"", which is the acronym of ""VLBI Observation for frb Localization Keen Searcher"".",astro-ph.IM

We perform a spectral analysis on the single-pulses of these RRATs for the first time, finding their mean spectral indices to be $-1.1 \pm 0.1$, $-0.6 \pm 0.1$, and $-1.2 \pm 0.2$ respectively, within the known range of pulsar spectral indices. We find no evidence for narrowband features as seen for FRB~121102. However, we find the spread of single-pulse spectral indices for these RRATs (ranging from $-7$ to $+4$) to be larger than has been seen in other pulsars, with the exception of the Crab pulsar. We also analyze the time between detected pulses, or wait-time, and find that the pulses are not random and cluster around wait-times of a few pulse periods as well as $\sim 25$ pulse periods for PSRs~J1819$-$1458 and J1317$-$5759. Additionally we find that there is no correlation between the wait-time and pulse flux density. Finally we find that the distribution of the pulse energy for PSRs~J1317$-$5759 and J1913$+$1330 are log-normal, while that of PSR~J1819$-$1458 is log-normal with possible evidence of an additional power-law component.",astro-ph.HE

For single-dish telescopes, those with a larger aperture tend to detect more FRBs than those with a smaller aperture if the FRB luminosity function index $\alpha_{\rm L}$ is steeper than 2, and vice versa.

The true constraint on the $H_2$ mass may be significantly higher, however, because of the reduction in CO luminosity that is common forlow-metallicity dwarf galaxies like the FRB host galaxy. These results demonstrate the challenge of identifying the nature of FRB progenitors through study of the host galaxy molecular gas.

arXiv:1803.01938,"J. I. Katz, ",Coherent Plasma-Curvature Radiation in FRB,"Curvature radiation is a natural candidate for the emission mechanism of FRB. However, FRB spectra have structure with $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim \text{0.03--0.2}$, inconsistent with the very smooth spectrum of curvature radiation. Although this spectral structure might be attributed to chromatic scintillation or lensing, in four FRB high spectral resolution data indicate scintillation decorrelation bandwidths much narrower than the observed $\sim \text{30--300}$ MHz spectral structure. Some of the observed structure may be intrinsic to the radiation mechanism. I suggest that the observed spectral structure reflects the spatial structure of a clumpy radiating charge distribution, and that the characteristic curvature radiation frequency may be much higher than the observed frequencies. In this coupled plasma-curvature radiation process the radiated spectra are the product of the spectra of the plasma wave and that of incoherent curvature radiation. The argument applies to all coherent radiation processes, including those that produce pulsar nanoshots. The implied FRB ""clump"" charges are large, and produce electrostatic potentials that suggest electron Lorentz factors $\gtrsim 10^2$. The result applies generally to coherently radiating sources.",astro-ph.HE

Here I assume that these events are separate bursts rather than multiple peaks from longer single bursts and consider their implications. They then are inconsistent with Poissonian statistics.

With 98\% confidence we reject the hypothesis of a homogeneous distribution in Euclidean space. Possible explanations include a reduction of fainter events by cosmological redshifts or evolution or a cosmologically local concentration of events.

arXiv:1703.04226,"J. I. Katz, ",Do FRB Mark Dark Core Collapse?,"Are some neutron stars produced without a supernova, without ejecting mass in a remnant? Theoretical calculations of core collapse in massive stars often predict this.

The existence of one repeating FRB with unchanging dispersion measure is not conclusive, but within a decade hundreds or thousands of FRB are expected to be discovered, likely including scores of repeaters, permitting useful statistical inferences. A na\""{\i}ve supernova remnant model predicts observable decline in dispersion measure for 100 years after its formation. If an upper limit on the decline of 2 pc/cm$^3$-y is set for five repeating FRB, then the na\""{\i}ve model with nominal parameters is rejected at the 95\% level of confidence.

The source can be a nebula inflated and heated by an intermittent outflow from a magnetar --- a neutron star powered by its magnetic (rather than rotational) energy. The object is young and frequently liberating energy in magnetic flares driven by accelerated ambipolar diffusion in the neutron star core, feeding the nebula and producing bright millisecond bursts. The particle number in the nebula is consistent with ion ejecta from giant flares. The nebula may also contain the freeze-out of electron-positron pairs $N_\pm\sim 10^{51}$ created months after the neutron star birth; the same mechanism offers an explanation for $N_\pm$ in the Crab nebula. The persistent source around FRB 121102 is likely heated by magnetic dissipation and internal waves excited by the magnetar ejecta. The volumetric heating by waves explains the nebula's enormous efficiency in producing radio emission. The repeating radio bursts are suggested to occur much closer to the magnetar, whose flaring magnetosphere drives ultrarelativistic internal shocks into the magnetar wind. The shocks are mediated by Larmor rotation that forms a GHz maser with the observed ms duration. Furthermore, the flare ejecta can become charge-starved and then convert to electromagnetic waves.",astro-ph.HE

By assuming the FRB emission to be produced within the magnetosphere, we derive a lower limit on the age of the magnetar, after which GHz emission is able to escape freely from the dense relativistic wind of the magnetar. Another lower limit is obtained by requiring the dispersion measure contributed by the electron/positron pair wind to be consistent with the observations of the host galaxy. Furthermore, we also derive some upper limits on the magnetar age with discussions on possible energy sources of the FRB emission and the recently-discovered persistent radio counterpart.

The $\gamma$-ray energy output is estimated as $E_\gamma \approx 5\times 10^{51}$\,erg at the nominal $z\approx 0.55$ redshift implied by the dispersion measure of FRB 131104. However, a long-term radio imaging follow-up observations only place an upper limit on the radio afterglow flux of Swift J0644.5-5111. Applying the external shock model, we make a detailed constraint on the afterglow parameters for the FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 system. We find that for the commonly used microphysics shock parameters (e.g., $\epsilon_e=0.1$, $\epsilon_B=0.01$ and $p=2.3$), if the redshift value inferred from the DM value is correct to order of magnitude (i.e., $z>0.1$), the ambient medium number density should be $\leq 10^{-3}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is the typical value for a compact binary merger environment but disfavors a massive star origin. Assuming a typical ISM density, one would require that the redshift of the FRB much smaller than the value inferred from DM value ($z\ll0.1$), implying a non-cosmological origin of DM. The constraints are much looser if one adopts smaller $\epsilon_B$ and $\epsilon_e$ values, as observed in some GRB afterglows. The FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 association remains plausible.

At a frequency of 5.5 GHz, the source has a mean flux density of 140uJy and is variable on short timescales with a modulation index of 0.36. Statistical analysis of the flux densities shows that the variations seen are consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation of the weak active galactic nucleus at the centre of the galaxy. It may therefore be the case that the FRB and the galaxy are not associated. However, taking into account the rarity of highly variable sources in the radio sky, and our lack of knowledge of the progenitors of FRBs as a class, the association between WISE~J071634.59-190039.2 and FRB~150418 remains a possibility.",astro-ph.GA

Williams \& Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the radio transient is analogous to a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN flare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a re-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio survey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence probability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the probabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same variability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient, without and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \sim 6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \sim 2 \times 10^{-3}$, respectively. In addition, the chance probability to have a fading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than $P_2 \sim 10^{-2.9\pm 1.3}$. Putting these together and assuming that the number of radio sources within one Parkes beam is 16, the final chance coincidence of having an FRB 150418-like radio transient to be unrelated to the FRB is $< 10^{-4.9\pm1.3}$ and $< 10^{-4.4\pm1.3}$, respectively, without and with the VLA point.

Assuming that the fading source is the afterglow of FRB 150418, I model the afterglow and constrain the isotropic energy of the explosion to be a few $10^{50}$ erg, comparable to that of a short duration GRB. The outflow may have a jet opening angle of $\sim 0.22$ rad, so that the beaming-corrected energy is below $10^{49}$ erg. The results rule out most FRB progenitor models for this FRB, but may be consistent with either of the following two scenarios. The first scenario invokes a merger of an NS-NS binary, which produced an undetected short GRB and a supra-massive neutron star, which subsequently collapsed into a black hole, probably 100s of seconds after the short GRB. The second scenario invokes a merger of a compact star binary (BH-BH, NS-NS, or BH-NS) system whose pre-merger dynamical magnetospheric activities made the FRB, which is followed by an undetected short GRB-like transient. The gravitational wave (GW) event GW150914 would be a sister of FRB 150418 in this second scenario. In both cases, one expects an exciting prospect of GW/FRB/GRB associations.",astro-ph.HE

@Lorimer et al. (2007); Cordes & Chatterjee 2019; Petroff et al. (2022):
These references are cited to provide background information on fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their characteristics, such as their brightness, duration, and temperature.

@Petroff et al. (2016); CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021):
Referenced to indicate the number of FRBs that have been detected so far, highlighting the growing body of observational data on FRBs.

@Bhardwaj et al. (2021); CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021):
Cited to support the statement that most FRBs have a high dispersion measure, which suggests an extragalactic origin for these events.

@Macquart et al. (2020):
Referenced to mention the identification of host galaxies for some FRBs, providing evidence for their extragalactic nature.

(2021); Wang et al. (2016); Gu et al. (2016); Dai et al. (2016); Ioka & Zhang (2020); Geng et al. (2021); Deng et al. (2018); Deng (2021):
These references are cited to discuss various proposed progenitors for FRBs, including magnetars, pulsars, neutron stars, strange stars, and primordial black hole mergers, highlighting the range of possible astrophysical sources for these bursts.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2020); Bochenek et al. (2020):
Referenced to mention the possible association between FRB 200428 and the Galactic magnetar SGR 1934 + 2154, supporting the magnetar origin hypothesis for some FRBs.
@Macquart et al. (2019):
Referenced to support the statement that the observed FRB spectrum strongly varies, with a single power-law function used to describe the spectrum and β values ranging from -15 to 10 among 23 observed FRBs.

@Li et al. (2021a):
Cited to mention the discovery of a tentative bimodal distribution of the specific isotropic equivalent energy (E µc ) at the central frequency (µ c ) from 1652 bursts observed with the FAST telescope.

@Aggarwal (2021):
Referenced to highlight the argument that the bimodal feature disappears when the burst energy is calculated over the entire FAST bandpass instead of the center frequency of the instrument.

@Planck Collaboration et al. (2016):
Cited to indicate the adoption of a flat ΛCDM universe with specific cosmological parameters throughout the paper.

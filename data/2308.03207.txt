@ [1]:
Referenced as a recent review that provides detailed information about the current understanding of fast radio bursts (FRBs).

@ [3]:
Cited to indicate that there have been approximately a thousand one-off FRBs observed after a few years of observations.

@ [4,5]:
Referenced to highlight the existence of more than 50 repeaters among FRBs.

@ [6]:
Cited to identify specific repeaters with high burst rates, namely FRBs 20121102A, 20180916B, 20190520B, and 20201124.

@ [7]:
Referenced to support the claim that the life cycle of super-repeaters cannot be much longer than a few years due to their high energy release.

@ [8]:
Cited to mention the repeater FRB 20200120.

@ [9]:
Referenced to indicate that the total energy of a burst can be significantly higher if data from the Galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154 is considered and the beaming of the radio signal is neglected.

@ [10]:
Cited as a review that discusses the expected life cycle of one-off FRB sources, which is estimated to be around a few thousand years.

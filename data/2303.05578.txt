@Pelissetto & Vicari 2002:
Referenced to support the idea of categorizing phenomena into universality classes based on their critical exponents, even without detailed knowledge of their microphysics.

@Aggarwal et al. 2022; Hewitt et al. 2022; Li et al. 2021; Niu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022:
These papers are cited to highlight the well-fit log-normal distributions of waiting times in repeating FRB and the relevance of the width of such distributions as a descriptor of the underlying dynamics.

@Hurley et al. 1994; Younes et al. 2020:
Referenced to emphasize the well-fit log-normal distributions of waiting times in SGR burst storms and their similarity to the distributions observed in repeating FRB.

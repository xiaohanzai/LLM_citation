@Bodmer 1971; Witten 1984:
These references are cited to support the statement that the equation of state of bulk matter at supra-nuclear density, with a focus on the role of strangeness, is an important factor in understanding the free energy of pulsar-like compact objects.

Referenced for a brief introduction to the topic.

@Haensel et al. 1986; Alcock et al. 1986:

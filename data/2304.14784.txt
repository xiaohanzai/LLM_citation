These references are cited to support the statement that astrophysical observations provide excellent conditions for higher precision measurements on the relative velocities of electromagnetic waves with different frequencies, which is relevant to determining the photon mass or placing an upper bound on it.

@39:
Referenced as a recent review that discusses how two photons with different frequencies, if emitted simultaneously from the same astrophysical source and traveling through the same distance, would be observed at different times if the photon rest mass is nonzero.

N/A
@40:
Referenced to support the statement that DM IGM can vary significantly along different lines of sight due to large intergalactic medium fluctuations.

@41; 42; 43:
Cited to highlight that numerical simulations show that the distributions of DM IGM and DM host are asymmetric and have a significant positive skew, which is relevant to the discussion of modeling DM IGM and DM host in FRB photon mass limits.

@31:
Referenced to mention that Lin et al. constrained the photon mass by considering more realistic non-Gaussian distributions for DM IGM and DM host, but without considering the degeneracy between the photon mass and cosmological parameters.

@44:
Cited to emphasize that relying solely on FRB data is difficult to simultaneously constrain the photon mass and cosmological parameters, even with only cosmological parameters, due to the parameter degeneracy.
@42,43:
These references are cited to support the use of the IllustrisTNG simulation in deriving accurate probability distributions of DM IGM and DM host for the analysis.

@45,46:
These references are cited to indicate the use of the latest Planck release data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to combine with the DM-z measurements from FRBs for parameter estimation.

@47:
This reference is cited to highlight the use of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in combination with FRB measurements and CMB data for parameter estimation.

@48:
This reference is cited to indicate the use of 1048 Pantheon SN Ia data in combination with FRB measurements, CMB data, and BAO data for parameter estimation.

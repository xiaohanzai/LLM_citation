@N/A
@1: Referenced to support the statement that FRBs are energetic bursts of coherent radio emission.
@2-5: These references are cited to support the statement that FRBs typically emanate from sources located well outside the Milky Way galaxy.
@6: Cited as a general reference to the wide variety of progenitor models and emission mechanisms proposed to explain FRB emission.
@7-9: These references are cited to indicate that FRB progenitor models involving magnetars are currently favored.
@10-13:
These references are cited to support the statement that FRBs and radio magnetars in the Milky Way galaxy produce radio emission with similar characteristics.

@11, 12:
These references are cited to establish the strongest link between FRBs and magnetars, specifically referring to the detection of an FRB-like radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154.

@14-17:
These references are cited to highlight the detection of a prompt short X-ray burst near the time of an FRB-like radio burst from SGR 1935+2154, suggesting the possibility of accompanying X-ray emission from extragalactic magnetars.

@15, 16:
These references are cited to describe the spectrum of the X-ray burst detected from SGR 1935+2154, indicating that it was harder than other short X-ray bursts from the magnetar.

@18:
This reference is cited to mention the radio band frequency range (roughly 100 MHz to 8 GHz) within which electromagnetic radiation from extragalactic FRB sources has been detected.

@19:
This reference is cited to provide the upper limit of the radio band frequency range (8 GHz) within which electromagnetic radiation from extragalactic FRB sources has been detected.

@20:
This reference is cited to introduce FRB 20200120E, a repeating FRB source discovered using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope and the CHIME/FRB system.

@21:
This reference is cited to specify the frequency range (between 400 and 800 MHz) of the daily radio observations conducted by the CHIME/FRB system.

@22:
This reference is cited to mention the localization of FRB 20200120E to a ∼10 Gyr-old globular cluster in the M81 galactic system during interferometric observations with radio telescopes from the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (EVN) Network.
@EVN [22]:
Referenced to indicate the source of the interferometric observations with radio telescopes that localized the FRB to a ∼10 Gyr-old globular cluster in the M81 galactic system.

@[23], [24]:
Cited to highlight the extremely narrow component widths of ∼10-100 ns observed in the radio bursts from FRB 20200120E, which is significant as it represents the shortest duration radio emission observed from any FRB source to date.

@[25]-[27]:
These references are mentioned to discuss previous simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of more distant FRB sources, emphasizing that the resulting upper limits have been unable to rule out most viable FRB progenitor models and that prompt X-ray emission on ultra-short timescales has not been searched for.

Referenced to provide the expected modest contribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) to the rotation measure (RM) of the FRB.

@Masui et al. (2015); Petroff et al. (2017); Michilli et al. (2018):
These papers are cited to support the statement that FRB RMs often exceed estimates from Galactic RM maps, indicating the potential to study the magneto-ionic properties of the local environments and hosts of FRB sources.
@Hilmarsson et al. (2021b):
Referenced to support the analysis of FRB 20121102A and its non-monotonically decreasing RM evolution, which is consistent with theoretical models describing it in terms of an evolving supernova remnant (SNR).

@Niu et al. (2021):
Cited to describe the similar interpretation of FRB 20190520B, which displays an association with a compact persistent radio source (PRS) and shares similarities with FRB 20121102A.

@Zhao & Wang (2021):
Referenced to argue for a young magnetar embedded in a wind nebula and SNR as a possible explanation for the observations of FRB 20190520B and FRB 20121102A.

@Desvignes et al. (2018):
Cited to draw interesting similarities with the RM behavior of the radio-loud Galactic center magnetar, which is related to its shared environment with the nearby supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A *.

@Xu et al. (2021):
Referenced to describe recent observations by the FAST telescope of FRB 20201124A, showing significant and irregular RM variations on week-long timescales, suggesting a high degree of nonuniformity in the local environment of the source.
@Piro & Gaensler 2018:
Referenced to support the statement that the observed behavior of the rotation measure (RM) is not consistent with the expected secular decrease, suggesting a high degree of nonuniformity in the local environment of the source.

@Dickel & Milne 1976; Milne 1987:
These papers are cited to propose an alternative explanation for the observed non-monotonic RM evolution, suggesting that it could be produced by the small-scale turbulent magnetic field of a supernova remnant (SNR), either through the relative motion between the fast radio burst (FRB) source and the small-scale field or through the dynamic evolution of turbulences in the SNR itself.
@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a,b; Fonseca et al. 2020:
These references are cited to indicate the sources of the previously published repeating FRB data that is discussed and analyzed in the paper.

"[57,58]": "The long duration of the GRB produced by a merger is supported by the prolonged lifetime of the accretion process by the magnetic barrier effect [56,[59][60][61]. The long GeV emission is a result of a long deceleration time of the GRB jet in a low-density circumburst medium, and the GeV excess can be explained with the inverse-Compton scattering of soft photons from the kilonova by hot electrons in the relativistic jet, both of which are also consistent with the compact binary merger scenario [57,58]."

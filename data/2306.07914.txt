@Rickett 1990; Ravi et al. 2016; Shannon et al. 2018:
These references are cited to explain the non-uniform shape of the pulse spectra of FRBs, which is attributed to interstellar scintillation caused by wave propagation through an inhomogeneous medium.

@Gourdji et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2021:
These papers are referenced to highlight that most FRB signals are band-limited and have varying degrees of spectral occupancy relative to the observing telescope's bandwidth.

@Pleunis et al. 2021:
This reference is cited to emphasize the rich and complex frequency-dependent intensity patterns exhibited by FRB signals, particularly in the case of repeating FRBs.

@CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018; Zackay & Ofek 2017; Bannister et al. 2019a:
These references are mentioned to point out that current statistical techniques for detecting FRBs assume uniform flux across the frequency band, which is not valid for FRB signals.

@Lorimer & Kramer 2004:
This citation is used to explain that the assumption of uniform flux across the frequency band is based on techniques developed for detecting broadband emission from radio pulsars.

@Spitler et al. (2012):
This reference is cited to introduce the multi-moment technique proposed by Spitler et al. for quantifying the normalized standard deviation in burst intensity across frequencies, which has been used to distinguish narrowband RFI from broad-band signals.

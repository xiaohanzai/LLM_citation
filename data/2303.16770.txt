@Petroff et al. 2022:
Referenced to provide more details and references about the number of detected and reported FRBs, including the number of repeaters and those with associated host galaxies.

@Nicastro et al. 2021:
Cited to emphasize the importance of repeating FRBs in studying their origin and the need to discover larger numbers of FRBs with accurate position measurements.

@Rajwade et al. 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a:
These papers are cited to support the claim that two repeating FRBs have been discovered to show periodicity in their activity cycle, suggesting a binary system origin.

@Ioka & Zhang 2020; Beniamini et al. 2020; Zanazzi & Lai 2020; Sridhar et al. 2021:
These papers are cited to acknowledge alternative explanations for the periodicity observed in repeating FRBs, apart from a binary system origin.

@Bochenek et al. 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b:
Referenced to highlight the extremely bright radio bursts and high-energy flaring observed from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, suggesting a link between neutron stars and FRBs.
@Tendulkar et al. 2021:
Referenced to support the need for a detailed examination of systems combining binary nature and magnetar connection in order to compare them to known FRB properties.

@Lu et al. (2020):
Cited to suggest that the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) repeater sample is consistent with the apparently non-repeating Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) sample, indicating they may come from the same population.

@Michilli et al. 2018; Nimmo et al. 2021:
These papers are cited to highlight that most of the repeaters are highly linearly polarized.

@Luo et al. 2020:
Referenced to mention that FRB180301 shows a diversity of polarimetric properties.

@Rajwade et al. 2020; Chime/Frb Collaboration et al. 2020:
Cited to state that only two out of the nearly 30 repeaters show a periodicity.

@Good et al. 2022; Li et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2021:
These references are cited to compare the repetition rates of some repeaters with notable repeating FRBs like FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A.

@Guo & Wei (2022):
Cited to introduce four new sub-types of repeaters and apparently non-repeaters based on the cosmic star formation history (SFH).
@Li et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2021:
These references are cited to acknowledge previous studies or works that are relevant to the topic being discussed.

@Guo & Wei (2022):
Referenced to support the application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test in the CHIME/FRB catalogue and the introduction of four new sub-types of repeaters and apparently non-repeaters based on the cosmic star formation history (SFH).

@Amiri et al. 2021:
Referenced as the publication of the first FRB catalogue by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration in 2021, which is significant as it is the first large-sample homogeneous FRB catalogue.

@Chen et al. 2022:
Cited to highlight the utilization of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on UMAP by Chen et al. in classifying repeaters and apparently non-repeaters in the FRB catalogue, emphasizing the importance of dimensionality reduction techniques for accurate classification of FRBs.
@Van der Maaten & Hinton 2008:
Cited to establish the historical popularity of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) as a nonlinear technique for dimensionality reduction in single-cell analysis before 2018.

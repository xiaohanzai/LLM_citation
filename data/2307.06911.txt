@7:
This reference is cited to acknowledge the ongoing debate about the physical mechanism responsible for FRBs.

@8:
Referenced to highlight the suggestion that the large observed dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs indicates an extragalactic or cosmological origin.

@9:
Cited to acknowledge the discovery of FRBs by the Parkes Telescope in 2007.

@70:
This reference is cited to mention the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) as a new telescope that has contributed to the detection of over one hundred FRBs.

@11:
Referenced to emphasize the need for better determination of density fluctuations in the dispersion measure (DM) due to spatial variation in cosmic electron distribution.

@12:
Cited to highlight the limitation of poor knowledge about the host galaxy contribution of FRBs (DM host) and the factors that influence it.

@13:
This reference is cited to mention a previous study that used a simple log-normal form to describe the redshift evolution of DM host with a median value of 100 pc cm-3.

@14:
Referenced to acknowledge previous works that studied different functions, including a normal or log-normal distribution, to describe the redshift evolution of DM host with a median value as a free parameter in the range 20-200 pc/cm3.
@15: Referenced to support the statement that the dispersion measure can be combined with the redshift to obtain the DM-z relation.

@16: Cited to highlight the potential of using FRBs to probe the anisotropic distribution of baryon matter in the Universe.

@17: Referenced to suggest that FRBs can be used to test the weak equivalence principle.

@18, 19: Cited to indicate that FRBs can be used to constrain cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant.

@20, 21, 22: Referenced to support the claim that FRBs can be used to constrain the Hubble constant.

@23, 24, 25: Cited to suggest that FRBs can be used to constrain the baryon mass fraction in the intergalactic medium (fIGM).

@26: Referenced to highlight the possibility of variation in fIGM with respect to redshift.

@27: Cited to provide an estimate of fIGM at a specific redshift.

@1: Referenced to indicate the use of a cosmological model-independent method to constrain fIGM.

@28: Cited to emphasize the challenge of identifying the host galaxy of FRBs and the scarcity of well-localized FRBs in the literature.

@69: Referenced to mention the coherent upgrade CRACO system of Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) as an instrument being built to localize FRBs.

@70: Cited to highlight the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) outriggers as an instrument being built to localize FRBs.

N/A: No citations appear in the text.
@29: Referenced to indicate that the literature has explored redshift distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) based on general aspects such as star formation history/rate.

@30: Cited to suggest that the literature has also explored redshift distributions of FRBs assuming a specific astrophysical origin, such as gamma-ray bursts.

@31: Referenced to direct the reader to a general analysis of possible redshift distributions of FRBs and related references.

@1: Cited to indicate that the mass of baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is obtained in a model-independent manner as presented in this reference, where FRBs data from Monte Carlo simulated data are combined with type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations.

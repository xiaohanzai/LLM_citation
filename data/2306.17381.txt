N/A
@Ruiter 2020:
Referenced as a source for the information about a promising progenitor of AIC being a merger remnant of binary carbon-oxygen WDs.

@Yoon et al. 2007:
Cited to support the statement that a merger remnant of binary carbon-oxygen WDs may cause a type Ia supernova if it slowly accretes from a tidally disrupted WD.

@Schwab et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2013:
These papers are referenced to highlight the findings of magnetohydrodynamic simulations reporting that magnetic viscosity leads to a high accretion rate and ignites carbon deflagration.

@Gvaramadze et al. 2019; Kashiyama et al. 2019; Oskinova et al. 2020; Lykou et al. 2023; Ko et al. 2023:
These references are cited to support the mention of WD J005311 as a WD merger remnant candidate, which is relevant to the discussion of the ignition of carbon deflagration.

@Saio & Nomoto 1985; Schwab et al. 2016:
These papers are cited to provide information about the conversion of materials of a merger remnant from carbon-oxygen to oxygen-magnesium-neon or heavier elements through carbon deflagration.

@Nomoto & Kondo 1991:
Referenced to support the statement that if the merger remnant has super-Chandrasekhar mass, it will cause AIC.

@Kashiyama & Murase 2017; Kirsten et al. 2022:
These references are cited to establish the connection between AIC and unresolved astrophysical phenomena such as fast radio bursts (FRBs).

@Gautam et al. 2022:
Cited to highlight the connection between AIC and the Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE).

@Bailyn & Grindlay 1990; Canal et al. 1990:
These papers are referenced to support the statement that historically AIC has been proposed to explain millisecond pulsars in globular clusters and galactic disks.

@Sawada et al. 2022:
Cited to mention the discovery of Fast Blue Optical Tangents (FBOTs) and their relation to AIC.

@Ofek et al. 2021; Mor et al. 2023:
These references are cited to further discuss the suggestion of FBOTs in relation to AIC.

N/A
@Baron et al. (1987):
Referenced as the pioneering AIC simulation that set a precedent for subsequent works on the topic.

@Woosley & Baron (1992), Fryer et al. (1999), Dessart et al. (2006):
Cited as subsequent works on AIC simulations that build upon the pioneering study by Baron et al. (1987).

@Sharon & Kushnir (2020), Mor et al. (2023), Longo Micchi et al. (2023):
Referenced as more recent studies on AIC simulations, highlighting the ongoing research in the field.

@Longo Micchi et al. (2023):
Cited as an example of a past work that employed Newtonian gravity, in contrast to the current study that takes into account general relativity (GR).

@Sharon & Kushnir (2020):
Referenced for suggesting that neutrino handling changes the dynamics of AIC simulations, contributing to the accuracy and reliability of the current study's results.
@Marquardt et al. (2015):
Referenced to support the statement that if silicon-group elements are formed, a white dwarf can undergo core-collapse instead of a type Ia supernova.

@Swift * https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/ Ëœpulsar/magnetar/main:
Referenced as a source of information about the magnetar Swift.

@Zhu et al. 7:
Cited as a previous study that included FAST data but focused on different analysis, highlighting the different aspects of the current study.

@25:
Referenced to indicate that measurements of upper limits at various radio instruments/frequencies were reported, providing context for the average fluence observed in the current study.

N/A
@28,29:
These references are cited to suggest that the magnetar radio emission might arise from the open field region in the magnetosphere above the polar cap, similar to the pulsed radio emission of canonical radio pulsars.

@30,31:
These references are cited to propose an alternative explanation for the magnetar radio emission, suggesting that it might originate from a j-bundle in the twisted magnetic lines within the magnetosphere, which is thicker in size and more energetic than the electron acceleration region above the polar cap.

@32:
This reference is cited to highlight the similarity between the observed narrow-band and frequency drifting emissions in SGR 1935+2154 and the morphology of fast radio bursts (FRBs).

@33:
This reference is cited to support the calculation of the radio emission location in SGR 1935+2154 based on the observed frequency drifting rate and the observation frequency.
